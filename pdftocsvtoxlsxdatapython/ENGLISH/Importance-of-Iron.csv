Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of iron.
00:05,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:08,Benefits of iron in our body.
00:11,Causes
00:13,and symptoms of its deficiency.
00:16,Food sources of iron.
00:18,Iron is required for several vital functions in the body.
00:24,It is a major component of hemoglobin and myoglobin.
00:29,Hemoglobin is present in red blood cells.
00:33,It helps to carry oxygen from lungs to different parts of the body.
00:39,Myoglobin transports and stores the oxygen in muscle cells.
00:46,"We require iron for growth,"
00:48,"brain function,"
00:50,"memory andconcentration."
00:53,It is also required for cell function and
00:56,hormone synthesis.
00:58,It aids in energy production
01:00,and formation of myelin.
01:03,Myelin is an insulation layer that forms around the nerves.
01:09,Iron also helps in maintaining strong immunity
01:12,and improving gut health.
01:15,Our body has 70 percent of iron in red blood cells.
01:21,"Twenty five percent is stored as ferritin in the liver,"
01:26,"spleen andbone marrow."
01:29,Six percent of iron is a component of protein.
01:33,"Protein is required for immune functions, metabolism and collagen synthesis."
01:41,We will now learn about the causes of iron deficiency.
01:46,Poor intake of iron and its poor absorption are major causes of its deficiency.
01:53,"Worm infestation, bacterial and viral infections are some of the other causes."
02:01,Excessive blood loss during menstruation and delivery can also lead to deficiency.
02:08,Lead poisoning is another factor that can cause iron deficiency.
02:14,In lead poisoning there is a decreased production of hemoglobin.
02:19,Excessive destruction of the red blood cells due to malaria is also a risk factor.
02:27,Iron storage in a full term pregnant woman can meet the infants iron requirement.
02:34,This is sufficient until the infant turns 4 to 6 months.
02:40,"However, preterm and low birth weight babies have poor iron stores."
02:46,They become deficient within the first 2 months.
02:51,An iron deficient pregnant woman will transfer less iron to the fetus.
02:57,Amount of iron in the brain reduces in case of intrauterine iron deficiency.
03:05,It also affects the babyâ€™s brain functions.
03:09,Children and adolescents are at a higher risk of deficiency.
03:15,Women of reproductive age are also at the risk.
03:20,I will now tell you the causes of iron deficiency in children.
03:25,The most common cause in children is inadequate intake
03:29,and rapid growth.
03:32,Low birth weight is another cause.
03:35,Iron deficiency causes anemia.
03:38,It is a condition where the iron stores in the body are depleted.
03:44,This reduces the supply of iron to tissues and red blood cells.
03:50,Let us understand the signs and symptoms of deficiency.
03:55,Brittle nails or spoon nails are symptoms of iron deficiency.
04:01,In spoon nails the soft nails look scooped out.
04:06,Pale skin and swelling of the tongue also occur due to the deficiency.
04:13,"Weakness, shortness of breath, headache, tiredness are other examples."
04:19,Pica is also one of the symptoms of iron deficiency.
04:25,Pica is an intake of inedible substances like clay or soil.
04:32,"In adults, iron deficiency can contribute to depression."
04:37,This is because of its connection with dopamine.
04:41,Dopamine is called a happy hormone which makes us feel good.
04:46,Iron is required for the production of dopamine.
04:51,Deficiency of iron leads to low levels of dopamine.
04:56,Iron deficiency has serious effects on infants and children's health.
05:02,Deficiency of iron during pregnancy can cause deficiency in the fetus.
05:08,This can affect language learning and
05:11,behavior in children.
05:13,Altered coordination and motor function are also seen.
05:18,It also causes a disruption in the development of the nervous system.
05:24,Deficiency of iron inhibits the formation of myelin sheath around nerves.
05:30,This can lead to hyperactivity
05:33,and lack of attention in children.
05:36,We will now see how anemia can be prevented in children.
05:41,Delayed cord clamping at the time of birth helps to prevent deficiency.
05:47,It improves the iron stores in the baby for first 6 months.
05:53,This reduces the risk of iron deficiency.
05:57,After 6 months iron rich food should be given through complementary food.
06:03,I will tell you the food sources of iron in the later part of the tutorial.
06:09,I will now tell you the recommended intake of Iron.
06:13,Recommended dietary intake of iron per day differs for different age groups.
06:20,6 to 12 months old infants require 3 milligrams.
06:25,1 to 3 years old require 8 milligrams.
06:30,For 4 to 9 years old it is 11 to 15 milligrams.
06:36,10 to 15 year old boys require 16 to 22 milligrams.
06:43,10 to 15 year old girls require 16 to 30 milligrams.
06:50,For adult men it is 19 milligrams.
06:54,For adult women it is 29 milligrams.
06:59,To meet these requirements it is advised to include iron rich food.
07:05,Let us look at the food sources of iron.
07:08,Dietary iron is present in two forms: heme iron and
07:13,non heme iron.
07:15,Heme iron comes from hemoglobin and myoglobin found in meat.
07:22,Hence non vegetarian food are good sources of heme iron.
07:27,"For example: goat meat, chicken, goat liver and brain."
07:33,Non heme iron comes from vegetarian food.
07:37,"For example: legumes, grains, and green leafy vegetables."
07:43,Heme iron is absorbed well in the body.
07:47,Non heme iron is not absorbed well and is affected by some factors.
07:53,Only 17% of it gets absorbed.
07:57,Calcium and phytates present in food inhibit the absorption of non heme iron.
08:04,"Roasting, germination and fermentation helps in reducing the phytate content."
08:10,Process for germination and fermentation is explained in other tutorials.
08:17,Please visit our website for more details.
08:20,To improve the absorption of iron it is recommended to have vitamin c.
08:27,Vitamin c helps in better absorption of iron.
08:31,Non heme iron absorption is improved when combined with heme iron.
08:37,We will now see the amount of iron present in different food items.
08:44,100 grams of goat liver has around 6 milligrams of iron.
08:50,100 grams of mutton has approximately 2 milligrams.
08:55,100 grams of chicken breast has nearly 1 milligram of iron.
09:01,100 grams of spinach has approximately 2.9 milligrams.
09:07,30 grams of kidney beans have around 1.8 milligrams.
09:13,Include these foods in your daily diet for good health.
09:18,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
