01:03,To prevent and control Coronavirus many types of face covers are being used.
01:10,Among them homemade protective face cover is easy to make and can be reused too.
01:18,"Before going ahead, please remember the important warnings."
01:23,Homemade face cover is not for health workers.
01:28,It is neither for people working with or in contact with COVID-19 patients.
01:37,COVID-19 patients should not use homemade face covers.

02:26,We will now see a simple method to make a reusable face cover at home.
02:33,It can be made using a cotton cloth which is easily available at home.
02:38,While making it ensure that it covers the mouth and nose completely.
02:44,One should be able to tie it over the face easily.
02:49,Homemade face covers can be easily made with and without a sewing machine.
02:55,Let us first see how to make a protective face cover with a sewing machine.
03:02,You will need a 100% cotton cloth.
03:06,The colour of the cloth does not matter.
03:10,"Before making, wash the fabric well"
03:13,and boil it in salt water for 5 minutes.
03:17,Let the cloth dry properly and then use it.
03:21,Other items required are:
03:23,Four pieces of cloth strips
03:26,"Scissorsand A sewing Machine"
03:29,I will explain the procedure to make a protective face cover.
03:34,Start with cutting the cloth for the face cover.
03:39,For adult it should be 9 inches x 7 inches.
03:44,For a child it should be 7 inches x 5 inches
03:50,Now we will cut the strips.
03:53,"For adult size face cover, cut 4 strips for tying and piping."
03:59,Two pieces each of 1.5 inches x 5 inches.
04:05,Also two pieces of 1.5 inches x 40 inches.
04:11,Attach a 1.5 inches x 5 inches strip on one end to use as piping to the fabric.
04:19,Create 3 pleats facing downward of about 1.5 inches each by folding the cloth.
04:28,Turn the pleated cloth to the other side and repeat the steps for pleating.
04:34,"Now, the height of the cloth will be reduced from 9 inches to 5 inches."
04:42,Secure the pleats with piping on both sides.
04:46,Take extra care to keep all pleats facing downward.
04:51,"Next, attach the long 40 inch strip to the top and bottom of the face cover."
04:59,Once again fold both these strips three times and stitch.
05:05,Your face cover is now ready to use.
05:09,While wearing it there should be no gaps between the face cover and your face.
05:15,The side facing you should show pleats facing downwards.
05:21,Never reverse the face cover for reuse
05:24,and wash it thoroughly after every use.
05:28,You should not touch your face or eyes.
05:31,Wash your hands thoroughly when you reach home.
05:35,Let us now see how to make a face cover without a sewing machine.
05:41,"You will need:100% cotton material or a menâ€™s cotton handkerchief"
05:47,and 2 rubber bands.
05:50,I will now explain the procedure to make the protective face cover.
05:55,Fold the handkerchief from one side to little above the middle of the cloth.
06:01,Now fold over the other edge to go above the first fold.
06:07,Fold this again evenly from the middle.
06:11,Take a rubber band and tie it on the left side of the cloth.
06:15,Now tie the other side with another rubber band.
06:20,Ensure that the area in the middle of the two rubber bands is big enough.
06:25,This will help you to cover your mouth and nose.
06:30,Take one edge of the cloth on the side of the rubber band and fold over it.
06:36,Do this for both sides.
06:38,Now take one fold and insert it into the other fold.
06:43,Your face cover is now ready to be used.
06:47,To wear this face cover just wrap each rubber band around your ears.
06:53,"As mentioned earlier, ensure that the face cover fits around your mouth and nose."
07:00,There should be no gap in between them.
07:04,Follow safety precautions before wearing a protective homemade face cover.
07:10,Wash your hands properly before wearing the face cover.
07:14,"As soon as the face cover becomes damp or humid, switch to another face cover."
07:21,"After every single use of the face cover, wash it for next use."
07:27,Every member in a family should have a separate face cover.
07:32,"While removing, do not touch the front or any other surface of the face cover."
07:38,Remove it only with strings behind or the rubber bands.
07:43,"For string face cover, always untie the string below and then the string above."
07:51,"After removing, immediately clean your hands with soap and water for 40 seconds."
07:58,You can also use 65% alcohol based hand sanitizer.
08:04,I will now tell you how to sanitize the face cover properly.
08:09,Please follow the method compulsorily.
08:12,Thoroughly wash the face cover with soap and warm water.
08:17,Dry it in hot sun for at least 5 hours.
08:21,"Alternatively, you can use a pressure cooker to sanitize."
08:25,Put the face cover in water in a pressure cooker.
08:29,Add salt and boil it for at least 10 minutes.
08:33,"Then, take it out and let it dry in a clean place."
08:38,You can also boil the face cover in hot water for 15 minutes.
08:44,"If you do not have access to a pressure cooker or boiling water, use a soap."
08:51,Wash and clean with soap
08:54,and apply heat on the face cover for 5 minutes.
08:59,You may use an iron box to apply the heat.
09:04,It is recommended that you make at least two face covers.
09:09,"You can wear one, while the other is washed and dried."
09:13,"Now, let us learn how to store the clean face covers."
09:18,"Take any plastic bag,clean it thoroughly with soap and water."
09:23,Let it dry properly on both the sides.
09:27,Keep the extra face cover in this clean bag and seal it well.
