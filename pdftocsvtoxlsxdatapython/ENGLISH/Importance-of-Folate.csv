Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of folate.
00:05,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:09,Role of folate in the body.
00:12,Effects of folate deficiency.
00:15,Requirements of folate for different age groups.
00:20,Vitamin B9 is an important water soluble B vitamin.
00:25,It has two forms:folate and folic acid.
00:30,Folate is the natural form and is found naturally in foods.
00:35,Folate is also produced by bacteria in our intestines.
00:41,"Whereas, folic acid is the synthetic form."
00:45,It is found in chemically enriched foods or supplements.
00:51,Folate is easily absorbed in our body as compared to folic acid.
00:58,We will now see the role of folate in our body and
01:02,the effect of its deficiency.
01:05,Folate is essential for various functions in our body.
01:09,"Our body needs it for growth, repair, division and production of new cells."
01:18,Folate helps in lowering the homocysteine levels.
01:23,Homocysteine is a type of amino acid used to make protein.
01:29,High homocysteine levels impairs cognitive function.
01:34,It also damages the blood vessels of the heart.
01:39,This increases the risk of heart diseases.
01:43,"Thus, folate helps in maintaining heart and cognitive function."
01:48,It is also required for a healthy pregnancy
01:51,and for closure of the neural tube.
01:55,The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord of the baby.
02:01,Failure in closure of neural tubes may result in neural tube defects.
02:07,Neural tube defects are the birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.
02:13,The two most common neural tube defects are anencephaly and spina bifida.
02:20,"In anencephaly, parts of a baby’s brain and skull do not form correctly."
02:27,"In spina bifida, the baby's spine does not develop properly."
02:33,"Thus, the baby can have physical disabilities."
02:38,They may develop muscle weakness of the legs and paralysis.
02:43,Curved spine and loss of urinary bladder control are other symptoms.
02:49,Difficulty in eating and swallowing is also common.
02:55,They may also have difficulty in learning and paying attention.
03:00,Closure of the neural tube takes place within 28 days of conception.
03:06,"Until this time, the woman might not even know that she is pregnant."
03:12,"By the time she knows, it might be too late to prevent these defects."
03:18,"All women, especially of reproductive age should take adequate folate rich food."
03:25,"Along with folate, other nutrients are important to prevent neural tube defects."
03:32,For example: vitamin B12 and choline.
03:39,"During pregnancy, the requirements of folate increases."
03:45,Inadequate intake during this time can result in folate deficiency.
03:51,Poor absorption of folate by the body can result in deficiency.
03:58,Even excess of alcohol intake results in the same.
04:03,A deficiency of vitamin B12 can indirectly lead to folate deficiency.
04:09,"Even if folate is present in our body, it will not be able to perform its function."
04:16,This is because vitamin B12 is required to convert folate into its active form.
04:24,"Thus, adequate intake of vitamin B12 along with folate is important."
04:31,"Eggs, chicken, meat and milk products are good sources of vitamin B12."
04:39,"Shellfish, liver, heart, kidneys, brain are other examples."
04:47,Individuals with genetic anemia can be at a risk of folate deficiency.
04:54,Examples of genetic anemia are sickle cell anemia
04:58,and thalassemia.
05:01,"In these conditions, red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be created."
05:08,"Thus, adequate intake of folate is recommended during these conditions."
05:14,Please consult your doctor before taking any supplement.
05:19,"Next, let us look at the symptoms of folate deficiency."
05:24,These symptoms can be seen in both men and women.
05:29,Some of the early signs are soreness and redness of the tongue and lips.
05:35,"Other symptoms are fatigue,"
05:38,"irritability,sleep disturbances"
05:41,and depression.
05:43,Ulcers in the mouth or stomach can also occur.
05:47,Long term deficiency can reduce memory and attention span.
05:53,Folate deficiency in pregnant women may have a bad effect on the babies.
05:59,For example: neural tube defects and
06:03,cleft lip and palate in babies.
06:07,A cleft is a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth.
06:13,This occurs when the tissues do not fuse together during growth in the womb.
06:20,Folate or vitamin B12 deficiency results in macrocytic anemia.
06:27,Let me explain to you how this occurs.
06:30,Both these nutrients are required for normal cell growth and division.
06:36,"In case of their deficiency, the red blood cells do not mature or divide properly."
06:43,"As a result, large immature red blood cells are formed which are few in number."
06:51,These have very low hemoglobin in them and are unable to function properly.
06:59,Hemoglobin helps to transport oxygen to other tissues and cells.
07:06,"Thus, low hemoglobin levels can cause anemia."
07:11,Let us look at the per day recommendations of folate for different age groups.
07:18,For 1 to 3 year old children 90 micrograms is required.
07:24,For 4 to 9 year old children it is 110 to 142 micrograms.
07:32,For 10 to 15 year old adolescents it is 180 to 204 micrograms.
07:42,More than 200 micrograms per day for adolescents above 16 years is recommended.
07:50,For adult females and males it is 200 to 250 micrograms.
07:58,Pregnant women should have about 500 micrograms.
08:02,"For breastfeeding mothers, it is 300 micrograms."
08:07,The requirements of folate are higher for women with a history of birth defects.
08:15,They should take 500 micrograms before conception and throughout pregnancy.
08:22,Adequate folate intake is also recommended for women who are planning pregnancy.
08:29,The requirements of folate can be met through diet.
08:33,Beans are excellent source of folate.
08:36,30 grams or 1⁄2 cup of uncooked beans gives about 80 to 120 micrograms of folate.
08:46,"Cowpea, kidney beans, moth beans, soybeans are a few examples."
08:53,"Even bengal gram, field beans, horse gram, dry peas are good sources."
09:00,Green leafy vegetables are also rich in folate.
09:04,"For example: spinach, amaranth leaves, colocasia leaves, agathi leaves."
09:11,50 grams or 1 cup of uncooked spinach will give about 70 micrograms of folate.
09:19,1 teaspoon of powdered drumstick leaves gives about 10 micrograms of folate.
09:27,"Other vegetables rich in folate are tender field beans, french beans and beetroot."
09:35,"Even cauliflower, ladies finger and drumsticks have moderate amounts of folate."
09:43,"Sunflower seeds, mustard seeds and niger seeds have little amount of folate."
09:50,1 tablespoon of these powdered seeds have about 15 to 20 micrograms of folate.
09:59,"Among non-vegetarian foods, chicken liver and all sea food are excellent sources."
10:06,1 chicken liver of 60 grams will give about 600 micrograms of folate.
10:13,100 grams of any seafood will give more than 700 micrograms.
10:20,Please note that excessive heat and water decreases folate content.
10:26,"Therefore, avoid overcooking and repetitive reheating of food."
10:33,Vegetables can be sautéed or steamed instead of boiling.
10:38,Pulses should always be soaked overnight before cooking.
10:43,Sprouting and cooking of whole beans enhances its nutrient content.
10:49,Fermentation and roasting will also help to improve the absorption of folate.
10:56,Adequate intake of folate is very important for our good health.
11:01,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thank you for joining."
