00:02,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on continuation of skin-to-skin contact after surgery.
00:11,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:14,Steps to continue skin-to-skin contact after the surgery is complete.
00:22,"In this tutorial, the Operating Room will be called OR."
00:28,Skin-To-Skin contact will be called STS.
00:34,Let us begin.
00:37,Early STS in the operating room is important for the mother and the newborn.
00:44,Its benefits and procedure are discussed in other tutorials of the same series.
00:53,Please visit our website for more details.
00:58,"Now, let’s discuss how to continue STS after completion of the surgery."
01:07,"At this stage, the sterile drape has been removed."
01:13,The mother is ready for transfer to the stretcher.
01:18,She will be taken to the recovery room on the stretcher.
01:24,"Before sliding the mother on to the stretcher, the baby should be repositioned."
01:32,The nurse should slowly and gently move the baby’s legs to a vertical position.
01:41,Baby’s head should be between the mother’s breasts.
01:46,The mother can cross her arms over her baby.
01:51,The nurse can place her hands on the top of the mother’s hands.
01:58,This will secure the baby during the mother's transfer to the stretcher.
02:05,"Now, she can be slid over to the stretcher."
02:11,This is a simple process.
02:14,The baby should never leave the mother’s chest during the transfer.
02:20,She can be in the same position on the way to the recovery room.
02:27,"So, the baby continues going through the 9 stages towards the 1st breastfeeding."
02:36,There are 9 natural stages or behaviours of a baby after birth.
02:43,The 1st stage is the baby crying immediately after birth.
02:50,The 2nd stage is relaxation during which the baby is very quiet and still.
02:59,3rd stage is awakening which starts with small movements of the baby’s head.
03:07,The baby opens her eyes and shows some mouth activity.
03:14,4th is the activity stage during which the baby opens up her eyes widely.
03:22,She touches the mother’s chest with her open mouth and lips.
03:29,She shows increased suckling movements.
03:34,She turns her face towards her mother’s breast.
03:40,5th stage is resting in which the baby rests until she is ready to move again.
03:49,6th stage is crawling in which the baby tries to reach the mother’s breast.
03:58,"After reaching the breast, 7th stage called familiarization begins."
04:06,"In this stage, the baby licks, touches and massages the breast and the nipple."
04:16,"Then, baby latches deeply to the breast to begin the 8th stage called suckling."
04:25,"Lastly, the 9th natural stage is sleeping."
04:32,Baby should never be lifted from the mother’s chest.
04:37,Ensure 1 hour of uninterrupted STS in the immediate post-delivery period.
04:47,At least this 1 hour must be given to the mother and the baby.
04:54,"Otherwise, the baby may become distressed and lose focus."
05:01,It could interfere with the adaptability of the baby’s body after birth.
05:09,"Before birth, baby was in the protected, calm and warm environment in the womb."
05:17,"Her body has to adapt to a bright, noisy and cold life outside the womb."
05:26,"When the baby is re-placed, the 9 stages must start all over again."
05:34,Baby will have to advance through all the stages once again.
05:41,Doing this second time will be quicker.
05:45,"However, this will delay breastfeeding."
05:50,"About 1.5 hours to 2 hours after birth, newborns fall into deep sleep."
06:02,"However, sleeping is the last of the 9 instinctive behaviours."
06:10,The 8 instinctive behaviours must be complete before the baby sleeps.
06:17,"If she has been interrupted several times, the baby may not complete them."
06:25,Baby will not experience suckling before sleeping.
06:31,It will happen several hours later when the baby awakens.
06:38,"After the baby awakens, she should be placed skin-to-skin again."
06:45,Baby will go through all the 9 stages again.
06:51,She will find the breast and attach deeply.
06:57,This instinctive behaviour may be present for the first 4 to 6 months after birth.
07:07,"This behaviour should be encouraged, especially in the first few days."
07:14,This will help the mother and the baby grow accustomed to breastfeeding.
07:22,"In the 1st few days, only STS is ideal for successful breastfeeding."
07:31,It will activate the baby’s instinctive feeding behaviours.
07:37,This will help the baby to quickly learn how to latch correctly.
07:45,"Later, the baby will be able to consistently latch deeply even without STS."
07:54,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
