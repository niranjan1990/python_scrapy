Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the Importance of protein.
00:05,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:08,Benefits of protein for our body.
00:11,Effects of its deficiency.
00:15,Requirements at different age groups.
00:18,Food sources.
00:21,Protein is an essential macronutrient required by our body.
00:27,It is made up of 22 amino acids.
00:31,"Out of 22, nine amino acids are essential."
00:36,"These are not made by our body, hence they have to be taken through food."
00:43,Remaining 13 are made by the body.
00:47,I will briefly tell you about Amino acids.
00:51,Amino acids are organic compounds that combine to form proteins.
00:58,"Lysine, leucine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, are a few amino acids."
01:09,Proteins are divided into 2 types.
01:12,They are complete proteins and incomplete proteins.
01:18,The difference between them is based on the type of amino acids present in food.
01:27,Complete proteins are those which contain all the 9 essential amino acids.
01:34,All non-vegetarian foods are complete proteins.
01:39,"For example: chicken,"
01:41,"eggs,"
01:43,fish and meat.
01:46,"Likewise, milk and milk products are also a source of complete proteins."
01:53,Incomplete proteins have inadequate amounts of 1 or more essential amino acids.
02:02,Most vegetarian foods are incomplete proteins.
02:06,"For example: pulses,"
02:09,"grains,nuts"
02:12,and seeds.
02:14,"Among all these, soybean is one of the best vegetarian source of protein."
02:21,"Benefits of protein include growth, repair and maintenance of muscle tissues."
02:30,It also controls blood sugar levels
02:33,and builds a stronger immune system.
02:37,Protein rich food reduces our cravings and keeps us full for a longer time.
02:43,This also helps in weight management.
02:47,Aid in digestion and breaking down of toxins are other two functions.
02:54,It also helps in carrying signals to and fro the brain.
03:00,Transporting and storage of nutrients in the body also requires protein.
03:06,Let us understand the signs and symptoms of protein deficiency now.
03:13,One of the signs of protein deficiency is diminished growth of the fetus.
03:20,Deficiency in children can lead to wasting and stunting.
03:26,This may result in low body weight.
03:30,"In such conditions, children are at a risk of developing various infections."
03:37,"Due to poor growth, a child's brain development can also get affected."
03:43,"In the long term, poorly grown children are at a risk of developing diabetes."
03:51,They may also develop hypertension when they grow up.
03:56,"In adults, protein deficiency leads to loss of muscle mass."
04:02,"They may also feel tired,"
04:05,"weakand become prone to infections."
04:09,Wrinkling of skin and hair fall are other examples.
04:15,Various age groups have different daily requirements.
04:20,Protein requirements advised in this tutorial are as per the field observations.
04:28,For 0 to 12 month old babies it is 1 to 2 grams per kg body weight.
04:36,16 grams of protein for 1 to 3 years old children is required.
04:43,20 grams for 4 to 6 year old children.
04:48,29 grams is advised for 7 to 9 year old children.
04:55,40 grams for 10 to 12 year old children.
05:00,52 to 62 grams is suggested for adolescents.
05:06,"For pregnant women, it is 78 grams."
05:11,"For lactating mothers, 68 to 74 grams is advised."
05:18,"For adults, protein requirement also depends on their physical activity."
05:25,"Activity is categorized as sedentary,"
05:30,"moderateand heavy."
05:33,"Sedentary activity includes teaching,"
05:36,"tailoring,"
05:38,data entry
05:40,and call center jobs.
05:44,People doing desk jobs also come under sedentary activity.
05:50,"Moderate activity includes agriculture labour,"
05:55,"househelp,mason"
05:58,and driver.
06:00,"Heavy activity includes stone cutter,"
06:04,"wood cutter,"
"",athlete
06:07,and mine worker.
06:10,Sedentary workers require 1 gram protein per kg ideal body weight.
06:18,Ideal body weight is optimum weight that is healthy for a person.
06:24,Moderate workers require 1.2 gram protein per kg ideal body weight.
06:32,Heavy workers require 1.5 grams protein per kg ideal body weight.
06:40,Let us understand this with an example.
06:44,A 55 kilograms moderate working woman's protein requirement would be 66 grams.
06:53,If the same woman is doing heavy work she will need 82 grams.
07:00,It is advised to include protein rich food in your daily diet.
07:06,Such foods should be given from 6 months of age.
07:11,Let’s take a look at the protein content of some of the food sources.
07:17,1 whole egg has around 7 grams of protein.
07:22,100 grams of boneless chicken has about 19 grams of protein.
07:29,"Similarly, 100 grams of fish has around 20 grams protein."
07:36,250 millilitres of cows milk has approximately 8 grams.
07:43,Curd made of 250 millilitres of cow’s milk has nearly 8 grams.
07:51,45 grams of paneer made from cow’s milk has about 8 grams of protein.
07:59,20 grams of nuts and seeds have nearly 4 grams.
08:05,Approximately 11 grams of Protein is present in 30 grams of raw soybeans.
08:14,Nearly 5 grams of Protein is present in 30 grams of other raw beans.
08:22,30 grams of uncooked pulses have approximately 4 grams protein.
08:30,30 grams of raw milled rice has around 2 grams.
08:36,30 grams of raw foxtail millet has nearly 4 grams protein.
08:43,1 chapati made out of 30 grams wheat flour has 3 grams of protein.
08:52,Sorghum and pearl millet chapati also has around 3 grams of protein.
08:59,4 grams of protein is present in one missi roti.
09:06,Missi roti is made with equal ratio of gram flour and wheat flour.
09:13,Protein from non-vegetarian food is absorbed better than vegetarian food.
09:21,It is because non-vegetarian foods have complete proteins.
09:27,Complete proteins contain all the essential amino acids.
09:33,"Thus, the quality of protein in the non-veg food is better than vegetarian food."
09:40,Quality of protein is checked by the DIAAS method.
09:48,DIAAS is Digestible indispensable amino acid score.
09:56,It is a ratio of digestible amino acid in food and the amino acid required.
10:05,The score is given from 0 to 1.
10:10,1 being the highest and 0 being the lowest.
10:16,Let us look at the digestibility score for a few food items.
10:22,Egg has a 1.18 digestibility score.
10:27,Whole milk has 1.32
10:31,Peas have 0.64
10:35,While chickpeas have 0.66
10:41,Cooked rice has 0.59
10:46,Wheat has 0.43
10:50,Roasted peanuts also have a score of 0.43
10:56,"As discussed earlier, vegetarian sources are incomplete proteins."
11:02,Cereals are low in lysine and pulses are low in methionine.
11:08,Eating them together will compensate for the insufficiency of amino acids.
11:14,Combining cereal and pulses improves the protein quality.
11:20,This is called the complementary action of proteins.
11:25,It is recommended to eat different food groups in various combinations.
11:31,Combining of food groups helps to get different essential amino acids.
11:38,Combining pulses and grains with milk products improves the protein quality.
11:46,The missing amino acids in grains and pulses are compensated by milk products.
11:54,Let us look at some food items prepared with these combinations.
12:00,"Millet khichdi with raita,"
12:03,"kadhi rice (gram flour curd curry -Bracketed text is only for International languages),and paneer paratha (cottage cheese stuffed tortilla -Bracketed text is only forInternational languages) are a few examples."
12:08,Thalipeeth with curd and
12:11,kidney beans rice with curd are other examples.
12:16,Combining cereal or millet with non-veg food also improves the protein quality.
12:24,I will tell you some recipes that can be prepared using this combination.
12:30,"They include millet chicken pulao,"
12:34,egg dosa and
12:36,chicken millet roti wrap.
12:39,"Egg rice,"
12:41,"meat stuffed paratha,"
12:43,"ragi balland chicken curry are other examples."
12:49,"Apart from these combinations, we can combine other food groups as well."
12:55,"Curd rice,"
12:57,"spinach paneer curry,"
12:59,coconut curd chutney are some examples.
13:04,Using paste of nuts and seeds in curries also improves the protein quality.
13:11,Include these food items in your daily diet for good health.
13:16,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
