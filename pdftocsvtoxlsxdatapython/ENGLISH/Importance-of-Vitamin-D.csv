00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial about the importance of vitamin D.
00:07,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:10,Role of vitamin D in the body.
00:14,Symptoms of its deficiency.
00:17,Recommended intake.
00:19,Food sources.
00:22,Let us begin by briefly understanding what is vitamin D.
00:28,Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin.
00:32,It exists in two forms: Vitamin D3 and
00:37,Vitamin D2.
00:40,D3 is mainly produced by the skin on exposure to UVB rays from sunlight.
00:49,UVB is known as ultraviolet B rays.
00:55,It is one of the 3 types of sun rays.
00:59,You can also get small amounts of D3 from non-vegetarian foods.
01:06,Vitamin D2 however is present in a few vegetarian foods.
01:13,Supplements of both Vitamin D2 and D3 are available in the market easily.
01:21,"Interestingly, Vitamin D obtained from all these sources is inactive."
01:28,"To become active, it has to undergo two processes."
01:33,First process of activation is in the liver and the second is in the kidney.
01:41,"Active form of vitamin D, also known as calcitriol, is formed in the kidney."
01:49,"Once vitamin D gets activated, it plays several roles in the body."
01:56,One of the major roles is formation and maintenance of strong bones.
02:03,Another is the absorption of calcium in the intestine.
02:09,Maintaining the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood is another role.
02:16,These two nutrients are required for growth and repair of bones.
02:22,They help in maintaining the correct bone density in our body.
02:29,"Apart from bones, they also help in maintaining strong teeth and"
02:35,muscles.
02:37,Vitamin D is an immunomodulator.
02:41,This means that it helps in controlling and supporting the immune system.
02:48,It helps to activate the body’s natural response to fight diseases.
02:55,Vitamin D protects the body against several respiratory infections.
03:02,"For example: pneumonia,"
03:04,"influenza,"
03:06,tuberculosis (TB)
03:08,and COVID-19.
03:11,Reduction in inflammation in the body is aided by vitamin D.
03:17,"Its other properties are to protect the body from viruses, bacteria and fungi."
03:26,Vitamin D is found to improve insulin sensitivity.
03:31,"Therefore, it helps in managing diabetes,"
03:34,blood pressure
03:36,and body weight.
03:39,It also maintains good heart health.
03:43,It does so by helping in relaxation of blood vessels in the heart.
03:49,"For many other functions in the body, vitamin D is essential."
03:55,"For example: cell division,"
03:58,brain development and
04:00,prevention of cancer.
04:03,"If the requirements of vitamin D are not met, there can be a deficiency."
04:11,Let us see what factors put someone at risk for vitamin D deficiency.
04:18,Inadequate exposure to sunlight is one of the major risk factors.
04:25,UVB rays from sunlight are required to produce vitamin D in the skin.
04:33,Glass windows block these UVB rays in the house.
04:38,"Hence, people with limited exposure to sunlight are at risk of deficiency."
04:46,For example: old people and people mostly working indoors.
04:53,Vitamin D deficiency is common in winter or in regions with cold climate.
05:00,The risk of deficiency is high in dark skinned people.
05:06,They have high amounts of a pigment called melanin in their skin.
05:12,This reduces the ability of their skin to produce vitamin D from sunlight.
05:20,They require longer exposure to sunlight as compared to light skinned people.
05:28,Inadequate intake of vitamin D from the diet is another risk factor.
05:34,"Additionally, vitamin D requires fat for its absorption."
05:41,"Hence, people with reduced ability to absorb fat can suffer from deficiency."
05:49,This can occur in people with gallbladder
05:52,or intestinal diseases.
05:56,Individuals with liver or kidney diseases are also at risk of deficiency.
06:03,Conversion of vitamin D  to active form takes place in the kidney and liver.
06:11,"Hence, people with liver or kidney diseases are also at risk of deficiency."
06:19,Obese people and those who have had bypass surgery can also become deficient.
06:26,Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers need vitamin D for the foetus
06:32,and the infant.
06:34,"Otherwise, the mother is at risk of becoming deficient in vitamin D."
06:42,"Next, let us understand the effects of vitamin D deficiency."
06:47,Signs of deficiency may vary with severity and age group.
06:53,"Some of the general signs are fatigue,"
06:57,"mood swings andpoor immunity."
07:01,"Muscle cramps, spasms and seizures are also seen."
07:07,"Without adequate vitamin D, bones become thin, soft and brittle."
07:14,Low vitamin D impairs the immune system.
07:19,"Thus, there is an increased chance of catching infections."
07:24,It also results in an increase in inflammation in the body.
07:30,All this makes a person more susceptible to getting infected with COVID-19.
07:37,The severity of effects of COVID-19 and
07:41,death due to it rises with deficiency.
07:46,The risks of several cancers also increase due to deficiency of vitamin D.
07:54,"Cancer of colon, prostate and breast are a few examples."
08:02,Low vitamin D levels can raise the risk of multiple sclerosis.
08:07,It is a condition in which protective covering of the nerve is damaged.
08:14,This disrupts the communication between the brain and body.
08:19,"It affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves."
08:25,Deficiency of vitamin D during pregnancy can result in a rise in blood pressure.
08:33,It can have negative effects on the baby also.
08:37,There can be an increased risk of premature birth and
08:42,low birth weight babies.
08:45,"Babies born to mothers with vitamin D deficiency, will also be deficient."
08:52,Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets in infants and children.
08:59,Rickets is a disorder of the skeletal system.
09:04,The growth gets stunted and there are changes in the shape of the spine.
09:10,"Other signs are sunken ribs, protruding forehead and bow shaped bent legs."
09:18,"Widening of the wrist, elbow, knee and ankle joints can be seen."
09:25,Children with rickets are also at a risk of getting infectious disease.
09:31,There is a delay in tooth eruption.
09:34,A pot belly and an abnormal walk is also seen.
09:39,"Muscle pain, irritability and increased sweating are other signs."
09:46,"In adolescents and adults, deficiency causes osteomalacia."
09:52,It is a condition of weakening and softening of bones.
09:57,The bones become easily prone to fractures.
10:01,"Severe pain in back,"
10:03,"hips,pelvis"
10:05,and legs can occur.
10:08,Other signs include muscle weakness and spasms.
10:13,"To avoid deficiency, getting adequate vitamin D is important."
10:19,"For infants of 0 to 12 months, 400 IU or 10 micrograms per day is recommended."
10:30,600 IU or 15 micrograms per day is recommended for people of age group 1 to 70 years.
10:42,"This includes children, adolescents, adults, pregnant and lactating mothers."
10:51,"For men and women above 70 years, 800 IU or 20 micrograms is recommended."
11:01,Many experts recommend much higher doses.
11:05,Let us now learn how to get adequate vitamin D.
11:10,Our body can produce it on exposure to UVB rays of the sunlight.
11:16,The best time to get maximum UVB rays is from 11 a.m to 2 p.m
11:26,15 to 20 minutes of daily exposure to midday sunlight is recommended.
11:33,"For dark skinned people, 3 to 5 times longer exposure in sunlight is needed."
11:41,"Approximately 10,000 IU of vitamin D is generated during this time."
11:49,Note that the body can’t make vitamin D if you are seated indoors by the window.
11:56,This is because the glass blocks the UVB rays.
12:01,"Hence, you should get sunlight from outdoors."
12:05,You can even keep the windows open and let the sunshine in.
12:11,"Next, let us look at food sources of vitamin D."
12:16,Only a small amount of vitamin D can be obtained from foods.
12:22,Among which fish are the best sources.
12:26,"For example: sardine, herring (hilsa -Hindi), black pomfret, salmon and cod."
12:33,100 grams of sardines has 3.5 microgram of vitamin D.
12:41,100 grams of herring fish (hilsa -Hindi) has about 5 microgram of vitamin D.
12:48,Other seafood like prawns and crabs also have little amounts of vitamin D.
12:56,100 grams of prawns have about 1 microgram.
13:02,Other non-vegetarian sources of vitamin D are egg yolk and
13:07,chicken liver.
13:09,100 grams of chicken liver has about 2.6 microgram of vitamin D.
13:17,2 egg yolks of about 40 grams have nearly 1.3 micrograms.
13:24,Few vegetarian foods have vitamin D.
13:27,"For example: mushrooms, soyabean, finger millet, sesame seeds."
13:34,100 grams of mushroom has around 20 micrograms.
13:39,50 grams of soybean has 33 micrograms.
13:45,"However, along with intake, absorption is very important."
13:50,Vitamin D3 is better absorbed and used in the body as compared to D2.
13:58,"Hence, sunlight and non-vegetarian food are best sources of vitamin D."
14:05,Please consult your doctor before taking any supplements.
14:10,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thanks for joining."
