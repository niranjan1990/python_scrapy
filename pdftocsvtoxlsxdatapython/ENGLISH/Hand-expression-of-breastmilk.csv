00:00,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Hand expression of breastmilk.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn- benefits of expressing breastmilk,"
00:12,how to express breastmilk by hand and
00:15,how often should a mother express breastmilk.
00:20,"Breastmilk expression is useful- to relieve breast engorgement,"
00:25,"to treat nipple soreness and dry skin on the dark area around the nipple,"
00:31,"to feed a baby if mother’s sore nipple is extremely painful while latching,"
00:38,"to increase or maintain mother’s breastmilk supply,"
00:42,"to keep breastmilk available for a baby when the mother goes out or to work,"
00:49,to help a baby to attach to a full breast by softening the dark area around the nipple;
00:57,"to check whether the baby has fed from one breast completely before offering the otherbreast,"
01:05,"to make nutritious complementary food for a baby by using breastmilk instead of water orcow’s milk,"
01:14,"and, to help in feeding milk to - premature babies,"
01:18,"sick babies,"
01:20,"babies with poor muscle tone,"
01:22,babies with cleft lip and/or palate and
01:27,babies who have difficulty in latching deeply to the breast.
01:32,"Now, let’s learn how to express breastmilk."
01:37,The most recommended way for a mother to express breastmilk is by using her hand.
01:44,Because this method causes less discomfort to the dark area around the nipple.
01:51,"Also, this method needs no appliance. So the mother can do it anywhere and at any time."
02:00,Expressing breastmilk by hand is a learned skill and will improve with practice.
02:08,It is easy to hand express breast milk when the breasts are soft.
02:13,"Therefore, a mother should learn this skill on the first or second day after delivery."
02:21,"Before expressing breastmilk, mother should have a steel or glass container ready to collectthe expressed milk."
02:29,"She should choose a cup, glass, jug or jar with a wide mouth."
02:36,She should wash the chosen container in soap and water.
02:41,"After that, she should either keep the container in boiling water or pour boiling water intothe container and leave it for a few minutes."
02:52,"Then, she should either air dry the container completely or wipe it dry with an unused cleancloth."
03:01,The container should never be dried with a used cloth such as a used kitchen cloth.
03:10,"After the clean container is dried completely, next step is to release breastmilk from thebreast."
03:17,"To help her milk flow, the mother should feel relaxed and emotionally connected to herbaby."
03:26,"Mother can try the following:She can sit quietly and privately or with a supportive friend."
03:34,"Some mothers can express easily in a group of other mothers who are also expressingbreastmilk."
03:41,She can hold her baby on her lap with skin-to-skin contact.
03:46,Or she can look at her baby or hear her baby’s voice.
03:53,Sometimes even looking at a photograph of her baby or smelling her baby’s clothing helps.
04:00,"She can take a warm soothing drink, but the drink should not be coffee, strong tea, alcoholor any stimulant."
04:12,She can also warm her breasts to help her milk flow.
04:17,"To warm her breasts, she can apply a cloth soaked in hot water to her breasts or have awarm water bath."
04:28,"She can stimulate her nipples and the dark area around them by-gently pullingor rolling them with her fingers."
04:38,She can massage her breasts lightly using circular movements.
04:44,Mother can ask a helper to rub her back.
04:47,"For the back rub, the mother should-sit down,lean forward,"
04:53,"fold her arms on a table in front of her andrest her head on her arms."
05:01,Her breasts should be unclothed and hanging loose.
05:07,The helper should rub down both sides of the mother's spine.
05:12,She should use her closed fist with her thumbs pointing forward.
05:17,"She should press firmly, making small circular movements with her thumbs."
05:24,"She should work down both sides of the spine at the same time from the neck to theshoulder blades."
05:34,She should do this for two or three minutes.
05:38,All these steps will help in releasing the breastmilk.
05:43,This release of breastmilk is called Oxytocin reflex or let down reflex.
05:51,"After the Oxytocin reflex begins, the mother must wash and dry her hands thoroughly."
05:59,"Then, the mother should sit comfortably."
06:04,She should lean forward slightly.
06:07,She should hold the container near her breast.
06:11,"Now, she should place her thumb and fingers on the breast in a C shape hold from the side."
06:20,"She can use either hand for holding either breast. And, she can switch to the other handwhen the first one tires."
06:29,"While holding the breast, her thumb should be on the upper part of the breast."
06:35,And her fingers should be placed opposite to the thumb on the lower part of the breast.
06:42,"Her thumb, nipple and fingers should always be in a straight line."
06:48,"And, the nipple should be in the middle of the thumb and the index finger."
06:54,"There should be a distance of 2 fingers between-the nipple and her thumb andthe nipple and her fingers."
07:04,"If the fingers are too close to the nipple, the milk may not flow for long."
07:10,"Mother will release more milk when she compresses the milk ducts beneath the dark areaaround the nipple."
07:19,"In this picture, the mother is holding her right breast correctly with her right hand."
07:27,"Now, she should press the breast slightly inwards towards the chest wall by applying steadypressure."
07:36,"Then, without moving the hand gently compress the breast between the thumb and thefingers."
07:44,And then release the pressure on the breast.
07:48,"The mother should repeat these 3 steps-Press back, Compress, And release."
07:56,The first step of pressing back towards the chest wall is an important step.
08:02,Pressing only towards the nipple will give very little milk.
08:07,"But when the breast is pressed back, milk from the dense breast tissue is released."
08:15,"But, avoid pressing too far back because that can block the milk-ducts."
08:23,"When the mother starts expressing breastmilk by hand, very few drops of milk may comeout at first."
08:30,"As the let down reflex starts, milk starts to drip out."
08:36,"In the first few attempts, it is common for the milk to drip out or come slowly."
08:42,"Later, breastmilk may flow in streams. As with breastfeeding, expressing breastmilk is askill that comes with practice."
08:53,"Colostrum, the first milk after birth, may only come in drops but is enough for thenewborn."
09:01,"The thick, often yellow, milk has enormous protective benefits for the baby."
09:08,The mother should repeat the 3 steps until the flow of milk slows down to a drip again.
09:15,Then she should re-position her fingers to express milk from other parts of the breast.
09:23,She can feel for where the breast seems fuller and compress those areas.
09:30,"She should express milk from one breast for at least 3 to 5 minutes until the milk flow slowsdown."
09:38,Then she should express milk from the other breast in the same way from all the areas.
09:45,"And then, again express milk from both breasts a second time."
09:51,Expressing breastmilk from both breasts adequately takes 20 to 30 minutes.
09:57,"It may take more time, especially in the first few days. As in those days, only a little milkmay be produced."
10:07,It is important not to try to express in a shorter time.
10:12,"Remember, expressing breastmilk by hand should not hurt. If it hurts, the technique is"
"",wrong.
10:21,Breast tissue is delicate.
10:24,"Avoid rubbing, sliding or pulling the fingers along the skin, towards the nipple.This can cause breast soreness."
10:36,Avoid tightening or stretching the skin over the dark area around the nipple.
10:42,"Also, avoid squeezing or pulling the nipple."
10:46,Pressing or pulling the nipple cannot express enough milk.
10:51,It is the same as the baby sucking only the nipple.
10:57,"After expressing breastmilk, the mother should cover the container with a clean cloth orplate."
11:04,"Then, she should store her breast milk safely for later use."
11:09,"Safe storage of breastmilk and feeding stored breastmilk to the baby are explained inanother tutorial."
11:19,Let’s now discuss how often a mother should express milk.
11:24,"If the purpose is to initiate and maintain breast milk productionOr to feed a low birth weight baby or sick newborn baby, then-"
11:35,she should express milk as soon as possible after delivery.
11:40,She may only express a few drops of Colostrum at first.
11:45,This helps breastmilk production to begin.
11:48,It acts similar to a baby suckling soon after delivery.
11:54,The mother should express as much as she can and as often as her baby would breastfeed.
12:02,"This should be at least every 2 to 3 hours, including during the night."
12:08,"If there are long intervals between expressions, she may not be able to produce enoughmilk."
12:16,"Next, if the purpose is to build up mother’s milk supply and if it seems to be decreasingafter a few weeks:"
12:25,"she should express breastmilk every 1 to 2 hours immediately after breastfeeding the babyand"
12:33,"if the baby is expected to sleep for more than 3 hours, then she can express in betweenfeeds."
12:42,"If the purpose is to relieve symptoms such as engorgement or leaking of breastmilk at work:the mother should express only as much as is necessary."
12:53,"If the purpose is to keep nipple skin healthy:the mother should express a small drop of breastmilk to rub on her nipple."
13:02,She should do this after a bath and after breastfeeding.
13:07,If the purpose is to keep milk for her baby while the mother is out at work:
13:14,the mother should express milk while at work to help keep up the supply.
13:20,"And, the mother should express breastmilk before going to work and leave it for the carer to"
"",give to the baby.
13:29,For doing this - mother can plan few weeks ahead if she has a fridge.
13:34,She can express extra milk and store it for later use.
13:39,Mother can express even after the baby has breastfed.
13:44,Mother should leave about 60 to 90 milliliters of milk for each feed.
13:51,More breastmilk can be given as per baby’s need while mother is away.
13:57,"Remember- the more frequent hand expression is used, the easier it becomes to expressmilk, the faster the milk releases."
14:07,"And, the more milk mother will make."
14:11,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
