00:00,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Kangaroo mother care.
00:05,"In this tutorial, we will learn -"
00:08,what is Kangaroo mother care?
00:10,"the components, importance and"
00:13,procedure of Kangaroo mother care.
00:17,Let us first begin with the introduction of Kangaroo mother care.
00:22,As the name suggests -
00:24,it involves keeping the baby in skin to skin contact with the mother.
00:29,"And, is popularly known as KMC."
00:32,"Remember, KMC should be given as soon as the baby is born."
00:39,It is especially recommended for low birth weight babies-
00:44,whose birth weight is less than 2.5 kilograms and
00:48,who do not require continuous monitoring.
00:52,"However, it can be used for all normal, healthy full-term babies too."
00:59,KMC consists of two main components:
01:03,continuous and prolonged skin to skin contact between the mother and her baby
01:10,and exclusive breastfeeding.
01:13,Let’s discuss these 2 components in detail.
01:17,The first component is skin to skin contact.
01:21,It improves the let down reflex
01:24,and ultimately increases the breast milk production.
01:28,Let down reflex has been explained in another tutorial of the same series.
01:34,The second component is exclusive breastfeeding.
01:38,Note that
01:40,exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months.
01:45,"Next, let’s discuss the importance of Kangaroo care."
01:50,Prolonged skin to skin contact during KMC helps maintain the baby's body temperature
01:57,and the baby feels more secure.
02:01,KMC also decreases
02:03,the frequency of infection and
02:06,the rate of apnea in babies.
02:09,Apnea is defined as long pauses in breathing.
02:14,Apart from these-
02:15,KMC improves the frequency and duration of breastfeeding.
02:21,"And, it strengthens the emotional bonding between the mother and her baby."
02:26,KMC also helps the baby-
02:28,to gain weight than any other conventional methods such as-
02:33,keeping the baby in radiant warmer
02:36,which creates stress for the baby and the mother.
02:40,It also improves the satisfaction and confidence in the mother
02:45,as she takes extra effort for her baby.
02:49,"Interestingly, apart from mothers, KMC can be provided by-"
02:54,father or
02:56,any other family member too.
02:58,We will now discuss the points to be followed by KMC provider.
03:04,The KMC provider should be healthy and free from illness.
03:09,He or she should follow basic hygiene practices such as-
03:14,"hand washing,"
03:16,"daily bath,clipped fingernails,"
03:19,tied up hair
03:20,and clean clothes.
03:22,"He or she should not wear any jewellery, watches and threads"
03:27,as these may become the barriers to maintain the hygiene
03:32,and it can cause injury to the baby.
03:36,"Now, let us discuss the type of clothes the provider should wear during KMC -"
03:43,clothes should be front open and lightweight.
03:46,"for example, sari-blouse or front open gown."
03:51,"Note that the KMC provider should wear this front open gown or blouse around KMCwrap."
03:59,Kangaroo bags or binders can be bought from the market as well.
04:04,These are useful if KMC has to be done for an extended period.
04:10,"Alternately, the KMC provider can use soft clean cotton fabric."
04:16,Whereas the baby during KMC should -
04:19,wear a cap and a nappy.
04:22,If the baby passes stool or urine during KMC then
04:27,she should be cleaned and dried thoroughly.
04:31,"Next, we will move ahead to the procedure of Kangaroo care in detail."
04:36,"Firstly, the mother should stand in an upright position."
04:41,"Then, either a health worker or any family member should do the following things step-wise-"
04:48,"by supporting the baby’s bottom and head,"
04:51,place the baby between the mother’s bare breasts in an upright position.
04:56,Then turn the baby’s head to one side.
05:00,Make sure the baby’s head is slightly bending backward.
05:05,This position will keep the baby’s nose airways open
05:08,and will allow the baby to make eye to eye contact with the mother.
05:14,Then bend the baby’s hips slightly outward.
05:18,"Remember to keep baby’s arms above the mother’s breast,"
05:23,the legs below the mother’s breast and
05:26,the baby’s abdomen on the chest of the mother.
05:30,"Before wrapping with the cloth,"
05:32,cover the baby with a blanket if environment is cold.
05:36,It will keep the baby and the mother warm.
05:39,Then wrap a cloth around the baby and mother’s chest and abdomen.
05:45,"While wrapping, make sure -"
05:48,the center of the cloth is on the baby
05:51,and both ends of the cloth should
05:53,pass through the armpits of the mother
05:56,and should cross at the back.
05:59,"After that, bring the edges of the cloth in the front."
06:03,Secure these edges of the cloth with a safe knot under the baby’s bottom.
06:10,This is comfortable and helps support the baby.
06:14,Also it avoids slipping of the baby.
06:17,"Remember, as the mother becomes comfortable, she should learn to wrap the cloth byherself."
06:24,"The technique of self-wrapping during KMC will be explained in another tutorial of thesame series."
06:32,It will increase the mother’s confidence and make her independent.
06:37,If mother is uncomfortable while using a cloth then she can use a stretchy band.
06:43,It is easy and comfortable to use.
06:47,"While using a stretchy band,"
06:49,adjust the edge of the band above the baby’s ear to support his head.
06:54,"Then, tilt the baby’s head slightly"
06:57,to breathe freely and
06:59,to make eye-to-eye contact with the mother as explained earlier.
07:04,The wrapped cloth or stretchy band should not be too tight or too loose.
07:11,It should be comfortable enough for the baby to breathe freely.
07:15,"Remember, while carrying a baby in KMC position, mother should be able to"
07:20,"walk, stand, sit or"
07:23,involve in different activities.
07:26,If a mother is very comfortable then
07:29,she can even sleep during Kangaroo care in a reclined or a semi-reclined position.
07:35,Now let’s discuss how to feed the baby during KMC.
07:41,Either mother can feed the baby
07:43,by simply loosening the wrapped cloth and
07:47,positioning the baby for breastfeeding.
07:50,"Or, she can manually express breast milk and"
07:54,feed the baby using a cup or a spoon.
07:58,"Remember, each day baby should gain up to 25 to 30 grams of weight."
08:03,"Hence, expected weight gain of a baby in a month is up to 900 to 1,000 grams."
08:10,"Hence, mother or health worker should"
08:13,monitor the weight of the baby during routine check-ups.
08:17,"If the baby fails to gain sufficient weight,"
08:21,health worker should monitor the breastfeeding technique of the mother or
08:25,check how many times the baby urinates.
08:29,"Also, guide the mother about the correct latching."
08:33,Correct latching has been explained in an another tutorial of the same series.
08:39,"Next, let’s learn how to remove the baby from the wrapped cloth."
08:44,"Firstly, the mother should sit in the upright position."
08:48,Then start untying the knot with one hand and
08:52,support the baby’s bottom with other hand on the outside of wrapped cloth.
08:58,"After that, loosen the wrapped cloth with the same hand which was earlier used for untyingthe knot."
09:05,Then shift the hand under the cloth which was supporting the baby’s bottom and
09:11,use the other hand to support the baby’s bottom from outside the cloth.
09:17,Then lift the baby up and free her from the wrapped cloth.
09:22,"After that, remember to hold the baby’s head in a way"
09:25,where the thumb is behind one ear and
09:28,other fingers are around the other ear.
09:31,"During KMC,"
09:32,the mother should immediately consult the doctor and the health worker -
09:37,"if the baby is not alert and active,"
09:41,"if the baby is breathing too fast or taking too long pauses,"
09:46,if the baby’s lips or tongue turns blue
09:50,and if baby’s feet are cold.
09:54,"This brings us to the end of this tutorialThanks for joining."
