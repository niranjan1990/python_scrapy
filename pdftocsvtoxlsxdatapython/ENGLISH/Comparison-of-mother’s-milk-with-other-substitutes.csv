00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on comparison of mother’s milk with other substitutes.
00:08,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:11,Advantages of mother’s milk.
00:15,Harmful effects of formula feed and animal milk.
00:20,Breast milk is a liquid source of complete nutrition.
00:25,"It contains water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins."
00:32,"Various vitamins, minerals, hormones and enzymes are also present in it."
00:40,This milk provides growth factors and immune protective factors to the infant.
00:48,Components of mother’s milk are discussed in detail in another tutorial.
00:55,Please visit our website for more details.
00:59,Let us look at some interesting facts about mother’s milk.
01:04,A mother’s milk is specially suited for her own infant.
01:10,Its composition does not remain constant.
01:14,It varies as per the changing needs of the growing infant.
01:19,"It changes from feed to feed, day to day and month to month."
01:27,The composition changes even during a single feed.
01:32,Let us understand this with the help of an example.
01:37,"Mother’s milk at the beginning of a feed has protein, sugar and is watery."
01:45,This helps to quench the infant’s thirst.
01:49,"Towards the end of the feed, the milk becomes thick and creamier."
01:56,It is rich in good fats which helps to keep the infant full and satisfied.
02:03,The volume of mother’s milk also changes depending on the age of the infant.
02:10,Many mothers choose some alternatives of their milk to feed the infant.
02:16,"For example, formula feed or animal milk."
02:22,"In this tutorial, we will be comparing them with mother’s breast milk."
02:28,"First, let us understand what is formula feed?"
02:33,Formula feed is an industrially prepared food product for infants.
02:39,It is usually in powder or liquid form.
02:43,"They are fed to the infants through bottles,"
02:46,cups or
02:48,spoons.
02:50,"Formula feeds consist of dehydrated animal milk,"
02:54,soya milk and
02:56,vegetable oils.
02:59,"Emulsifiers, artificial sugars and preservatives are also added to it."
03:06,All formula feeds are very expensive.
03:10,"Unlike mother’s milk, its composition is not unique for each infant."
03:16,It is a standard product with the same composition for all the infants.
03:22,"Formula feeds do not have antibodies, living cells and good bacteria."
03:29,Many of the enzymes get destroyed in processing of formula feeds.
03:36,"Hence, there is a poor absorption of nutrients from them."
03:41,Formula fed infants have different gut composition than those who are breastfed.
03:49,This may have a long term consequence on the infant's health.
03:54,Formula feeding reduces the growth of good bacteria in the intestine.
04:01,It promotes the growth of disease causing bacteria.
04:06,It also increases the risk of intestinal complications in premature infants.
04:14,This can lead to the damage and death of intestinal tissue in those infants.
04:21,Such babies are critical because their intestinal tissue dies.
04:27,Formula fed infants often have a stomach upset.
04:32,"They may face issues like abdominal gas,"
04:36,"bloatingand diarrhea."
04:39,Infants who are formula fed are more likely to get problems of obesity.
04:45,The risk of developing diabetes
04:48,and hypertension later in life is also high.
04:53,The chances of sudden death in formula fed infants below 1 year of age is high.
05:01,Bottle feeding also causes breathing through the mouth instead of the nose.
05:07,All these reasons may increase the risk of sleep apnea.
05:13,It is a condition in which breathing is interrupted while sleeping.
05:19,Bottle feeding can result in dental caries and
05:22,protrusion of the front teeth.
05:26,The risk of infections is higher in formula fed infants.
05:31,"For example: Pneumonia,"
05:34,"diarrhea andear infections."
05:37,They are more likely to have asthma and wheezing as well.
05:43,Formula feeding may increase the risk of skin allergies in infants.
05:49,Negligence in preparing the formula feed correctly can cause more harm.
05:56,Let’s understand this with an example.
05:59,"If too much powder is added to water, it results in dehydration in infants."
06:07,It can also cause a rise in the body’s sodium levels.
06:12,"As a result, the infant can show signs like irritability,"
06:17,lethargy and
06:19,seizures.
06:21,High sodium levels also put a load on the immature kidneys of the infant.
06:27,"As mentioned earlier, formula feeds are expensive."
06:32,"To use it economically, mothers may add less powder in excess water."
06:39,"If less powder is used, infants can remain hungry"
06:42,and lead to poor weight gain.
06:46,Hygiene needs to be maintained while preparing
06:49,and storing formula feeds.
06:52,Formula feed has to be prepared in hot and clean water.
06:58,"If prepared in cold and dirty water, it can cause infection in infants."
07:05,The feeding bottles have to be cleaned
07:08,and sterilised frequently.
07:11,"If it is poorly cleaned, or cleaned with dirty water, it can cause infection."
07:18,"So far we discussed formula feed, let’s now talk about animal milk."
07:25,"Milk from cows, buffaloes, goats, etc. is called as animal milk."
07:33,Many people think that animal milk can be a substitute for breastmilk.
07:39,"However, this is not true."
07:43,Let me explain to you the reason.
07:46,The nutrient composition of mother’s milk and animal milk differs.
07:52,Animal’s milk has a high amount of a type of protein called casein.
07:58,It is 6 to 7 times higher as compared to mother’s milk.
08:05,"This high casein content of animal milk forms a tough, hard curd."
08:11,It is difficult for young infants to digest casein.
08:16,"Whereas, mother’s milk has a high amount of whey protein."
08:22,It is easier for infants to digest whey protein as compared to casein.
08:29,Feeding cow’s milk to infants increases the risk of an allergy to milk proteins.
08:36,It may also lead to iron deficiency anemia in infants.
08:43,Iron deficiency in infants can impair cognitive and physical development.
08:50,Iron in both animal milk and mother’s milk is low.
08:56,"But, iron in mother’s milk is more easily absorbed than from animal milk."
09:03,Fifty percent of the iron from mother’s milk gets absorbed.
09:09,"Whereas, only 10% of the iron gets absorbed from cow’s milk."
09:16,"Sometimes, allergy to animal milk proteins can cause blood in stools."
09:23,This may worsen the iron levels in the infant.
09:27,"Animal’s milk has low contents of zinc, niacin, vitamin A, C and E."
09:35,Good fats which are required for brain development are also low in animal milk.
09:41,"Thus, breastfed infants have higher IQ than infants fed formula or animal milk."
09:51,"Animal milk contains a high amount of protein, sodium, and potassium."
09:58,It also has high levels of chloride and phosphorus.
10:04,This may put a load on the immature kidneys of the infants.
10:09,"As a result, they may suffer from dehydration."
10:14,The high phosphate load can lead to calcium deficiency in infants.
10:20,Animal milk has other disadvantages similar to formula milk.
10:26,For example: lack of antibodies and
10:29,good bacteria in them.
10:32,"Hence, it is best to avoid animal’s milk until the infant is one year old."
10:40,"Compared to animal and formula milk, mother’s milk has environmental benefits."
10:47,"Animal and formula milk involves processing,"
10:50,packaging and
10:52,transportation.
10:54,This can increase the expenses and
10:57,waste production.
10:59,A lot of resources and time is also required in its preparation.
11:06,"Whereas, mother’s milk does not involve packaging or"
11:10,transportation.
11:12,"It does not produce any waste, smoke or noise."
11:18,There is a risk of spoilage too in animal milk and formula milk.
11:24,They can get spoilt due to bacterial contamination.
11:29,"Whereas, mother’s milk is always fresh at a warm temperature."
11:36,Substituting mother’s milk with other milks has adverse effects on her health.
11:43,Women who do not breastfeed have a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
11:50,The risk of developing other diseases is also high.
11:55,"For example: diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases."
12:02,Mothers who breastfed have better cognition at their later age.
12:08,Mothers who feed formula milk are more likely to retain their pregnancy weight.
12:14,"Hence, the risk of obesity is high in them."
12:19,They are also at a risk of developing bone diseases later in life.
12:26,This may result in pain and fracture in hip or knees.
12:32,Postpartum depression can also be seen in them.
12:37,"Note that, exclusive breastfeeding can act as a natural birth control."
12:43,This birth control is ineffective if the mother doesn't breastfeed exclusively.
12:50,"Thus, the mother should not substitute her milk with other milks."
12:56,This increases the chances of less space between two pregnancies.
13:03,"As a result, the mother and her infant are at an increased risk of malnutrition."
13:10,"To conclude, there is no perfect substitute for mother’s milk."
13:16,Excessive marketing and promotion of mother’s milk substitutes are done.
13:22,As a result there is a decrease in exclusive breastfeeding.
13:27,"However, mother’ milk is the only best source of nutrition for the infants."
13:34,It is safe to consume and suited for the infant’s changing developmental needs.
13:42,Breastfeeding has numerous benefits for both infant and the mother.
13:48,"Thus, exclusive breastfeeding should be done upto 6 months."
13:54,"After 6 months, complementary food should be started along with breastfeeding."
14:01,Breastfeeding should be continued at least until 2 years.
14:06,Correct breastfeeding techniques are explained in other tutorials.
14:12,Please watch them for effective breastfeeding.
14:17,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
