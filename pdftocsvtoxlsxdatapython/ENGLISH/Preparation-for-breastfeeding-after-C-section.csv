00:26,"In this tutorial, the Operating Room will be called OR."
00:33,Skin-To-Skin contact will be called STS.
00:38,Let us begin.
00:40,Early STS in the operating room is important for the mother and the newborn.
00:47,It could benefit them during the surgery and the immediate postoperative period.
00:56,It strongly affects their long-term and short-term health problems.
01:03,It makes breastfeeding easier.
01:07,"During skin-to-skin contact, mothers are highly focused on their newborn baby."
01:15,This focus on the baby helps them feel less pain.
01:22,"When they feel less pain, their anxiety level decreases."
01:29,This helps in maintaining normal heart rates of the mother and the baby.
01:36,This also helps in maintaining normal blood pressures of both.
01:43,"During skin-to-skin contact, mothers and babies keep each other warm."
01:51,This helps in maintaining their normal body temperature.
01:57,"So, STS should be done in the operating room immediately after delivery."
02:05,It is essential that the hospital staff is comfortable with the process.
02:12,"For this, adequate and appropriate preparation is necessary."
02:19,Such preparation must be done both before and during the cesarean delivery.
02:27,It involves all those responsible for newborn care.
02:33,They include the mother and her immediate relatives.
02:39,"They also include the doctors,"
02:42,"nursesand the operating room staff."
02:47,Educate these people about the reason for introducing STS in the operating room.
02:55,Explain to them as to how the mother and newborn baby will benefit.
03:03,They may be anxious about beginning skin-to-skin contact in the operating room.
03:10,"To reduce their worry, assure them of the safety of mothers and babies."
03:18,Safety and well-being of mothers and babies will always be the first priority.
03:26,Concerns arising in the operating room are to be calmly and clearly dealt with.
03:34,"During the surgery, doctors may sense a medical emergency related to the mother."
03:42,"In such cases, skin-to-skin contact in the operating room may not be completed."
03:50,The newborn will be taken up for requisite care in an appropriate setting.
03:57,"Before the delivery, a nurse should be assigned to help in the operating room."
04:04,She should introduce herself to the mother.
04:08,She must confirm that the mother wants STS in the operating room.
04:15,"Next, let’s discuss the steps to be followed in the OR, before the delivery."
04:23,"In the operating room, the mother’s arms may be tied to the arm boards."
04:29,The arm board with the IV line is preferred to be tied to the left arm.
04:37,The other board with the blood pressure cuff is tied to the right arm.
04:44,"In such cases, the assigned nurse can be helpful."
04:50,She should ask the doctor if the right arm can be released for STS.
04:57,She should tell the mother that this arm would be used to hold the baby for STS.
05:05,This arm will be straightened every few minutes to measure her blood pressure.
05:12,She must maintain the room temperature at 25 degree celsius.
05:19,This temperature is suitable for the baby’s arrival.
05:25,The nurse must ensure that the mother is not wearing a bra.
05:31,Mother’s gown should be unbuttoned.
05:35,This will help lower it easily to uncover her chest when placing the baby.
05:42,The nurse must notice the position of intravenous lines.
05:49,This will help her avoid them when placing the baby.
05:54,"Lastly, she must keep a diaper or nappy,"
05:58,"warmed towelsand blankets ready."
06:03,They will be used to dry and cover the baby.
06:08,The preparation for skin-to-skin contact in the operating room is now complete.
