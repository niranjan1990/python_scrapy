00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on type 1 and type 2 nutrients.
00:06,This tutorial is about the difference between type 1 and type 2 nutrients.
00:12,Let us begin.
00:14,Food gives us energy and nutrients.
00:17,Nutrients are necessary for the growth and maintenance of our body.
00:22,Some of these nutrients cannot be produced by our body.
00:27,Such nutrients are called essential nutrients.
00:31,There are 40 essential nutrients that we must obtain from food.
00:36,We cannot get adequate amounts of these nutrients from nutrient-poor foods.
00:42,"Such foods, even in large amounts, can satisfy only the feeling of hunger."
00:48,"However, we can be deficient in one or more of the essential nutrients."
00:54,This is known as hidden hunger.
00:58,Essential nutrients are divided into 2 types:
01:02,Type 1 nutrients or functional nutrients
01:05,and Type 2 nutrients or growth nutrients.
01:09,"Iron,calcium,"
01:11,"iodineand copper are type 1 nutrients."
01:15,"Manganese,"
01:17,"fluorineand selenium also belong to the same group."
01:21,"Vitamin B,C,"
01:23,"A,D,"
01:25,"Eand K are type 1 nutrients as well."
01:29,"Sulphur,chlorine and"
01:32,protein or essential amino acids are type 2 nutrients.
01:37,"Sodium,potassium,"
01:39,"magnesium,phosphorus"
01:41,and zinc also belong to the same group.
01:45,Essential fatty acids like omega 3 are type 2 nutrients as well.
01:51,Let’s understand the difference between type 1 and type 2 nutrients.
01:56,Type 1 nutrients are required for specific functions in the tissues.
02:02,"Therefore, they are concentrated in a particular tissue or group of tissues."
02:08,Let’s take calcium and vitamin A as examples.
02:13,Calcium is required for strong bones.
02:17,Vitamin A is required for healthy eyes.
02:21,"By contrast, type 2 nutrients are required for the overall growth of the body."
02:28,They form part of the structure and function of each and every cell in the body.
02:34,"Therefore, they are present in all body tissues"
02:38,Let’s discuss the response of our body to type 1 and 2 nutrient deficiencies.
02:45,"During a type 1 nutrient deficiency, the body continues to grow normally."
02:50,Body takes this nutrient from the specific tissues in which it is stored.
02:57,Let’s take calcium as an example.
03:00,"In calcium deficiency, the body uses the calcium stored in the bones."
03:07,"As a result, the concentration of that nutrient in the tissues decreases."
03:13,"Then, the organs dependant on that nutrient are affected."
03:18,"Therefore, the person becomes ill."
03:21,The sick person then shows a specific sign of deficiency.
03:26,Let’s understand this with the help of 4 examples:
03:31,1. Bone-thinning and increased risk of fractures are signs of calcium deficiency.
03:37,2. Anaemia is a sign of iron deficiency.
03:41,3. Night blindness is a sign of vitamin A deficiency.
03:45,4. And Hypothyroidism is a sign of iodine deficiency.
03:50,"On the other hand, there is only 1 sign of type 2 nutrient deficiencies."
03:57,That sign is called growth failure.
04:00,Growth failure means the body reduces the rate of 2 major processes:
04:06,1. Formation of new cells and
04:09,2. Replacement of old cells.
04:11,The body stops growing and making new tissues.
04:16,"This leads to low body weight,"
04:18,short height
"",and decreased muscle mass.
04:23,"All the cells of the body, including the immune system, are affected."
04:29,This increases the risk of infections.
04:32,"Eventually, it can cause death."
04:35,Type 2 nutrients are not stored in the body.
04:39,"In a deficiency, the body may start to break down its tissues or muscles."
04:45,This releases the type 2 nutrient in which the body is deficient.
04:50,This nutrient will then be used for other tissues of the body.
04:56,"When tissue breakdown becomes severe, the functions of the cells are affected."
05:02,"Also, there is a reduction in the appetite."
05:05,The tissue breakdown provides the nutrient in which the body is deficient.
05:11,"However, it also releases all the other type 2 nutrients from the tissues."
05:17,These nutrients are then excreted from the body.
05:21,"So, all type 2 nutrients must be provided in a type 2 nutrient deficiency."
05:28,Correcting a type 1 nutrient deficiency does not require all type 1 nutrients.
05:34,It can be treated by giving only the nutrient in which the body is deficient.
05:40,"Next, let’s discuss the availability of type 1 and 2 nutrients from breastmilk."
05:47,Breastmilk contains stable stores of type 2 nutrients.
05:52,They do not change even if the mother is undernourished.
05:57,The baby of an undernourished mother can grow well with adequate breastfeeding.
06:03,"By contrast, the quantity of type 1 nutrients in breastmilk is not stable."
06:09,It varies as per mother’s self-nourishment.
06:13,Let’s take vitamin D as an example.
06:17,Breastmilk of a mother deficient in vitamin D has less amount of vitamin D.
06:23,"Next, let’s discuss the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 nutrient deficiencies."
06:30,A type 1 nutrient deficiency is commonly diagnosed in 2 ways.
06:36,"First, the unique symptoms of the deficiency are recognised."
06:41,"Then, the level of the nutrient in the body is measured by a blood test."
06:46,Let’s take iron and iodine as examples.
06:50,"In iron deficiency, symptoms such as pale skin and fatigue are recognised."
06:56,The level of haemoglobin in the body is measured by a blood test.
07:01,Iodine deficiency is also diagnosed by its unique symptoms and tests.
07:07,"Symptoms such as swelling of the neck,"
07:10,weight gain and
07:12,hair loss are recognised.
07:14,The level of iodine and thyroid hormones in the body is measured by blood tests.
07:21,Type 1 nutrient deficiencies are well recognised and treated.
07:26,There are various ways to correct a type 1 nutrient deficiency.
07:31,One can take the recommended amount of these nutrients in the diet.
07:36,Supplements are also recommended for these nutrients.
07:41,"Iron,"
"",vitamin C and
07:43,folic acid supplements are commonly prescribed.
07:47,Food is fortified with type 1 nutrients in areas where deficiency is common.
07:53,A well-known example is salt that is fortified with iodine.
07:59,A qualified nutrition expert can provide guidance on these methods.
08:04,Diagnosis and treatment of a type 2 nutrient deficiency is difficult.
08:10,There is only 1 way to diagnose any type 2 nutrient deficiency.
08:15,It is to measure and track
08:17,"the weight,Height"
08:19,and mid upper arm circumference.
08:22,"However, this will only help in detecting growth failure."
08:27,Growth failure is caused by every type 2 nutrient deficiency.
08:33,It is difficult to determine which specific nutrient the body is deficient in.
08:40,"So, correcting a type 2 nutrient deficiency requires all type 2 nutrients."
08:47,Food rich in all type 2 nutrients must be given in such a deficiency.
08:53,Increasing only the quantity of previously given food will not work.
08:59,Previously given food failed to provide type 2 nutrients to the body.
09:04,The quality of food must be changed for normal growth of the body.
09:10,Please consult a qualified nutrition expert for further guidance.
09:15,Food sources of type 1 and type 2 nutrients are discussed in other tutorials.
