Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Breast conditions in lactating mothers.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about- Breast engorgement and Mastitis."
00:13,Let us begin with Breast engorgement.
00:17,Engorgement occurs most commonly between 3 to 5 days after delivery.
00:23,It occurs in both breasts simultaneously.
00:28,Mother should not confuse breast engorgement with breast fullness.
00:33,"Thus, now we will discuss the difference between breast engorgement and full breasts."
00:40,"In engorgement, breast becomes firm, swollen and painfully full of milk."
00:46,It gives shiny appearance and shows dilated veins on the surface.
00:52,"Mother may suffer from fever that lasts for more than 24 hours and latching becomes hardfor the baby."
01:01,"Whereas, full breasts are normal."
01:04,Full breasts appear big but they do not give shiny appearance.
01:10,Full breasts are not painful and fever is absent during breast fullness.
01:17,"Now, let’s discuss the causes of breast engorgement in lactating mothers."
01:23,Breast engorgement can occur in the following conditions-
01:27,If mother has not fed the baby soon after delivery.
01:32,Mother is not feeding the baby frequently.
01:36,Baby has poorly latched on mother’s breast during breastfeeding and
01:42,Mother has stopped breastfeeding suddenly.
01:46,Now let’s discuss how engorgement can be treated.
01:51,First- Ask the mother to wash her hands with the clean water
01:55,"Then, bring the baby closer to the mother so she can see, smell and touch the baby."
02:03,"If baby is too fussy, mother can smell the baby’s towel."
02:08,"After that, mother should drink a glass of water."
02:12,"Then, keep wet warm cloth on the breast for 5 to 10 minutes or"
02:18,mother can also take a warm shower.
02:21,It will help the breast milk to come out.
02:24,"After that, health worker should tell the mother to relax as excess of stress will affect thelet-down reflex and"
02:33,milk will not come out.
02:36,"Now, either health worker or any family member should massage on the mother’s neck andupper back."
02:43,It will help the breast milk to come out.
02:46,"Since, nerve supply towards upper back and breast is same."
02:52,"Then, mother should start gently massaging her breast in circular motion."
02:57,Massaging will make her relax and will improve the let-down reflex.
03:03,All these things will help in releasing of Oxytocin.
03:07,It is known as Oxytocin reflex or let-down reflex.
03:12,Oxytocin is a hormone which helps a breast milk to come out.
03:17,"Then, mother should manually express some amount of milk to soften the areola."
03:23,It will help the baby to latch on the breast correctly.
03:27,"During expressing the breast milk, mother should apply pressure around the areola."
03:33,"After expressing, mother should guide the areola in the baby’s mouth, as it would bedifficult for a baby to self-attach."
03:42,Try to breastfeed on both sides.
03:46,"Between the feeds, mother should keep wet cold cloth on breasts for 5- 10 minutes. Or,"
03:53,mother can keep cold cabbage leaves on breasts.
03:58,She can store these cabbage leaves either in refrigerator or in earthen pot.
04:04,It helps in reducing the tenderness and edema in the breast.
04:08,Then mother should breastfeed frequently.
04:13,"Now, let’s learn how can we prevent breast engorgement."
04:17,"First, try to understand the hunger signals of a baby such as squirming,"
04:25,increasing rooting reflex-
04:27,"in rooting reflex, baby turns her head towards anything which touches her cheek or mouth."
04:36,sucking on fingers.
04:38,"In late stage, the baby starts crying."
04:42,"Breastfeed the baby whenever she shows early hunger signals and not wait for the baby tocry."
04:50,Make sure that the baby is latched on properly and feeding well.
04:55,"Remember, empty one breast completely before you switch to the other side."
05:02,"Next, let’s learn another breast condition called Mastitis."
05:07,"It is a condition where part of breast becomes red, swollen and hard."
05:14,"Mother feels severe pain, fever and ill."
05:18,Many mothers go through mastitis in first 6 weeks.
05:22,"But, it can occur at any time during lactation."
05:27,It is sometimes confused with breast engorgement.
05:31,"However, engorgement affects whole breast and often both breasts."
05:37,Whereas mastitis affects part of the breast and usually only one breast.
05:44,Mastitis may develop in an engorged breast or follow condition of blocked ducts.
05:51,"Now, we will discuss how blocked duct develops into mastitis if untreated."
05:58,Blocked duct is a condition where milk is not removed from the part of a breast.
06:04,Usually this duct is the part of breast blocked by thickened milk.
06:11,"It leads to lump formation. This lump is tender and often present with redness of the skinover the lump."
06:20,Blocked duct and breast engorgement causes milk stasis.
06:24,"When milk stays in part of a breast in blocked ducts and breast engorgement, it is calledstasis."
06:32,"If this stasis is not removed, it could lead to inflammation of breast tissue. It is called non-infective mastitis."
06:42,"Whereas, sometimes breast becomes infected with the bacteria and this is called infectivemastitis."
06:51,"In following conditions, bacteria will easily enter through fissure:"
06:56,"if fissure is present on the breast, Mastitis remains untreated and delayed treatment."
07:06,Note that breast abscess is a progression of untreated mastitis.
07:11,"Now, let’s discuss the causes of mastitis."
07:15,The first and foremost cause of mastitis is infrequent feedings.
07:21,If lactating mother is a working woman then frequent breastfeeding becomes challenging.
07:27,Other reason for infrequent feedings could be illness in mother or a baby.
07:33,"Second is nipple feeding. In nipple feeding, baby will not empty the breast completely."
07:40,Third is oversupply of milk.
07:43,Fourth is rapid weaning where baby eats other foods apart from breast milk.
07:49,"Fifth is tight clothes- if mother uses tight clothes, especially in night if mother wears a tightbra, it brings pressure on the breast and can block the milk ducts."
08:02,"Sixth is maternal stress - if mother is going through any stressful conditions, it will affectthe let-down reflex."
08:12,"Seventh is nipple fissure- it provides a way for bacteria to enter the breast tissue and maylead to mastitis."
08:22,Let’s look at the treatment for mastitis.
08:26,First try to identify the cause and then start the treatment.
08:31,Mother should use warm compresses before breastfeeding
08:34,or should take a warm shower.
08:37,She should start breastfeeding from affected breast first.
08:42,"If it is increasing the pain or affecting the let-down reflex then start with the unaffectedbreast."
08:50,"Remember, frequent breastfeeding is necessary."
08:55,"If the open wound is not on the nipple or on the areola then mother can breastfeed on theaffected side."
09:03,"Remember, whenever a mother is feeding to a baby from mastitis breast-"
09:09,"she should monitor the baby for signs of infection as there will be a risk of infection to ababy"
09:17,since breast milk from affected side will have many harmful bacteria.
09:24,Massaging the breast may improve the milk supply.
09:28,It should be a gentle massaging from affected area towards the nipple.
09:33,"And, mother should take enough rest."
09:36,If symptoms are severe then she should refer to the doctor.
09:40,Breast abscess will require surgical drainage of abscess and antibiotics.
09:47,"Apart from these, mother should make a special effort to relax her body and breathe deeplyand evenly."
09:55,Listen to the soothing music and think about her baby to help in starting the let-down reflex.
10:03,"Remember, for preventing mastitis, correct latching is necessary."
10:09,It will avoid blocked duct and baby will get enough milk.
10:14,"Keys to prevent all these breast conditions are- proper attachment and positioning of a babyand frequent breastfeeding."
10:24,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
