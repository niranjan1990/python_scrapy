00:01,"Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the measurement of children’s weight andheight."
00:07,"In this tutorial, we will learn:"
00:09,How to measure a child’s weight using the salter scale.
00:16,The digital scale.
00:18,We will also learn to measure his length or height.
00:24,Anthropometry is the most frequently used method to assess nutritional status.
00:31,"Anthropometric measurements include height, weight, circumferences, etc."
"00:3800:44","Let us learn how to measure weight using a salter scale.Salter scale is a spring hanging scale."
00:49,It can weigh up to 25 kgs.
00:54,"To measure weight, you will need weighing pants or bucket."
01:01,"In this tutorial, we will be using weighing pants."
01:06,"Before weighing the baby, attach the pants to the scale."
01:12,Adjust the scale to zero.
01:16,"Then, remove the pants from the scale."
01:20,Undress the baby.
01:23,It is best to weigh the baby without any clothes.
01:29,"Now, put your hands through the open areas of pant's legs."
01:36,Gently grasp the baby’s feet and put the baby in the pants.
01:43,Now attach the pants to the scale in a way that the baby hangs freely.
01:50,Make sure the baby doesn’t touch anything.
01:55,Do not touch the scale or the baby.
02:00,Stand in front of the scale so that the pointer is at your eye level.
02:07,Wait till the child stops moving.
02:11,"Otherwise, the needle will move when reading the weight."
02:16,"When the child is steady, read the weight on the scale."
02:21,Read it up to the nearest 100 grams mark.
02:27,Write down the weight immediately so you don’t forget it.
02:32,The scale must be checked every day by using a known weight.
02:39,Do not forget to re-adjust the scale to zero before every weighing.
02:47,"Next, let us learn how to measure weight using a baby digital scale."
02:55,Clean the tray.
02:58,"Put the weighing scale on a flat, stable surface like a table or a platform."
03:06,Connect the power plug.
03:09,"If the scale runs on batteries, put the batteries in it."
03:15,Switch it on.
03:18,The digital display will show some number.
03:22,Adjust the digital display to zero by manually adjusting the knob.
03:30,Some weighing scales have automatic zero display.
03:35,Place a clean and dry towel or paper on the tray.
03:41,This will reduce the chances of a drop in the baby’s body temperature.
03:48,It will also prevent the transfer of infections.
03:53,Undress the baby.
03:56,Place the baby on the towel in the middle of the tray.
04:02,Note the reading on the digital display.
04:06,Write it down.
04:09,Switch the machine off after use.
04:13,Remember to use a separate clean and dry towel for each baby.
04:21,Check the accuracy of the weighing scale with standard known weights every week.
04:29,Do not press the weighing tray with your hand.
04:33,It could damage the weighing machine.
04:37,"Next, let us learn how to measure weight using a family digital scale."
04:45,"Digital or electronic scales provide quick, easy and precise measurements."
04:53,Family digital scales can be used in two different ways to weigh children.
05:01,Children who can stand up can be weighed by making them stand on the scale.
05:09,Other children can be weighed in the arms of an adult.
05:14,This is also called double weighing.
05:19,"To weigh the child, place the scale on a hard and flat surface."
05:25,A wooden board can be used if you are weighing the child on the field.
05:31,Explain the procedure to the child’s mother or carer.
05:37,"Take off the child’s clothes, if possible."
05:42,Turn on the scale.
05:45,Tell the child to stand on the scale.
05:49,"If the child can’t stand, ask the mother or an assistant to stand on the scale."
05:57,"After the adult’s weight appears, press the reset button."
06:04,Zero must appear before the child is given to the adult to be weighed.
06:11,The weight displayed will be the child’s weight.
06:16,Write down the weight immediately so you don’t forget it.
06:21,Handle the scale with care.
06:25,Protect the scale from excess humidity or excess heat.
06:32,"Next, let us learn how to measure a child’s length or"
06:37,height.
06:39,Length is used for children shorter than 87 cm or
06:45,under 2 years of age.
06:49,Height is used for children taller than or equal to 87 cm or over 2 years of age.
07:01,"For length or height measurement, you will need a height board."
07:07,You will need 2 people to take the measurement.
07:12,You will need support from the carer when taking the measurement.
07:19,You must take off the child’s shoes and socks.
07:24,Remove anything that covers the child’s head as well.
07:31,"For length measurement, put the height board flat on the ground."
07:37,Lay the child on the board.
07:41,The child’s head should be touching the fixed board end.
07:46,The child’s feet should be towards the movable foot piece.

08:22,"Now, the second person should position himself properly."
08:28,He should sit on his knees near the foot piece.
08:33,He should straighten the child’s legs.
08:38,"With one hand, he should hold the child’s knees firmly on the board."
08:45,"With the other hand, he should move the foot piece."
08:50,He must move it until it is pressing against the heels of the child.
08:57,He should not tilt the foot piece.
09:02,The child should lay completely flat on the height board.
09:08,The person holding the foot piece should read the length of the child.
09:14,His eyes must be straight above the measuring tape while reading.
09:21,Length can be read up to 1mm of accuracy.
09:27,He must write down the length immediately.
09:32,"Now, let us learn how to measure a child’s height."
09:38,"For height measurement, put the height board straight up."
09:44,Make sure the fixed board end is flat on the ground.
09:50,The movable headpiece should be at the top end.
09:55,Put the back of the board against a flat wall.
10:01,Remove the child’s footwear.
10:04,Tell the child to stand on the centre of the fixed board.
10:09,The child’s heels must be pressed against the height board.
10:16,The child’s knees must be straight.
10:20,The child’s shoulders and head should be pressed against the board.
10:26,The child’s hands must be at the sides.
10:31,The child should look straight ahead.
10:35,The first person should sit on her knees on the side of the board.
10:41,Her left hand should be on the child’s knees.

11:12,He must hold the headpiece straight with one hand.
11:18,"With the other hand, he should cup and hold the child’s chin."
11:24,"Now, he should read the height."
11:28,"While reading, his eyes should be straight in front of the measuring tape."
11:34,He can measure the height up to 1mm of accuracy.
11:40,He should write down the height immediately.
11:45,Detailed interpretation of these measurements is discussed in other tutorials.
11:52,Please visit our website for more information.
