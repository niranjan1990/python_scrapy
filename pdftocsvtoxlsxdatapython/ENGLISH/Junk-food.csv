00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on junk food.
00:04,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:07,Contents of junk food
00:09,and harmful effects of junk food on our body.
00:14,Any food can be considered as junk food depending upon three factors.
00:20,First two factors are ingredients
00:23,and the method of cooking.
00:26,The nutrient content of the food is the third important factor.
00:32,"Junk food contains a high amount of sugar, salt, refined fat and refined flour."
00:41,Most of the junk food is usually prepared by frying or baking.
00:48,"Many artificial colours, flavours and preservatives are added to these food."
00:56,"This is done to enhance the taste, appearance and shelf life of the food."
01:03,Junk food are high in calories.
01:07,"They have none or little amounts of protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals."
01:15,A few commonly consumed junk food are deep fried salty snacks.
01:22,Majority of the fast food are also junk food.
01:27,"For example: pizza, burgers, french fries, noodles, puff pastry, samosa, etc."
01:39,Some beverages are considered as junk food.
01:43,"For example: cold drinks, fruit juices and artificially flavoured drinks."
01:51,"Even caffeinated drinks, soda and energy drinks are included."
01:57,"Sweets, deep fried sweets, jams, jellies, sauces, ketchups are also junk food."
02:07,"Biscuit, cake, chocolate, candy, ice cream are other examples."
02:14,Let us now see the effect of junk food on our body.
02:18,Junk food which is high in sugar causes immediate rise in blood sugar levels.
02:24,"As a result, the pancreas releases insulin in our blood."
02:30,Insulin is a hormone which acts like a key to open the cells.
02:35,The cells absorb sugar from the blood to provide us energy.
02:42,Excess sugar gets stored as fat in the body.
02:48,Regular eating of high sugar food can cause insulin resistance.
02:54,"During insulin resistance, the body is unable to respond to insulin or use it."
03:02,"Therefore, sugar is not taken up by our cells from the blood."
03:07,"As a result, there is a rise in insulin levels and blood sugar levels."
03:14,The high insulin levels send signals for hunger to the brain.
03:20,The body starts craving more food even if it is not hungry.
03:26,This creates a vicious cycle and causes overeating.
03:32,Let us understand this with an example.
03:35,"While eating a biscuit or ladoo, we can't restrict ourselves to one piece."
03:42,We crave to eat it more and more.
03:45,We mostly finish the entire packet of biscuits or many ladoos at a time.
03:52,This is because of the hunger signals which are sent to the brain.
03:57,Sugar also has an effect on blood pressure.
04:02,"On eating food high in sugar and salt, our sodium level increases."
04:08,Sugar enhances the sodium absorption in the body by the kidney.
04:14,"As a result, sodium gets retained in the body."
04:18,This causes an increase in blood pressure and water retention in the body.
04:25,"As a result, puffiness in hands and feet can be seen."
04:30,Let me give you an another example.
04:34,After eating chips we usually feel thirsty.
04:38,This is because sodium levels in our blood increases on eating salty food.
04:45,The brain then sends signals of thirst so that we drink more water.
04:51,Drinking water will dilute the sodium levels in the body.
04:56,"But, drinking juice or cold drinks will increase the sugar levels in the body."
05:03,This will result in a rise in the blood pressure.
05:07,"Apart from sugar and salt, most junk food have a lot of refined flour."
05:14,Refined wheat flour is most commonly used.
05:18,These refined flours are low in fiber and lack essential nutrients.
05:24,Fiber has a very important role in the body.
05:28,It gets digested slowly
05:31,and gives us a feeling of fullness for a long time.
05:35,"Therefore, when we eat junk food low in fiber, it gets quickly digested."
05:42,Our stomach gets empty very quickly and we feel hungry again.
05:47,Another important benefit of fiber is to maintain a healthy gut.
05:53,Our gut comprises of both good and bad bacteria.
05:58,Fiber promotes the growth of good bacteria.
06:02,"Thereby, helping in proper digestion and absorption of nutrients."
06:08,"Other benefits are strong immunity,"
06:11,"healthy skinand reduced inflammation."
06:15,Fiber is also necessary for our stools to absorb water.
06:21,This makes the stools soft and bulky.
06:25,"Thus, the stools moves easily through the intestine."
06:31,"Since junk food is low in fiber, eating it regularly can cause constipation."
06:38,The other disadvantage is that junk food reduces the good bacteria in the gut.
06:45,This increases inflammation
06:47,and the risk of various diseases.
06:50,Some junk food are high in refined fats like trans-fat.
06:56,"Cakes, biscuits, baked products, margarines, vanaspati all have trans-fat."
07:05,Trans-fat raises the level of bad cholesterol
07:08,and lowers good cholesterol.
07:11,Cholesterol is a type of fat found in our blood.
07:16,"Good cholesterol helps in proper working of the brain, skin and heart."
07:23,"But, excess of bad cholesterol is not good for our health."
07:28,Mostly fried junk food is prepared using oils containing omega 6 fatty acid.
07:35,"Examples are sunflower oil, safflower oil, soybean oil."
07:41,Even corn oil and cottonseed oil are included.
07:46,The omega 6 in these oils raises the level of bad cholesterol in our body.
07:52,Excess of bad cholesterol gets deposited on the walls of our blood vessels.
07:58,Excess of omega 6 fatty acid also enhances inflammation in the body.
08:06,This results in the development of insulin resistance and heart diseases.
08:12,Excessive consumption of junk food has many harmful effects.
08:17,"Obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes are the most common."
08:23,They can also cause a risk of increased bad cholesterol and heart diseases.
08:30,"Sleep disturbancesor development of cysts in the ovaries can also happen."
08:37,Eating too much junk food can upset the stomach.
08:42,"You may experience nausea, vomiting and reduced appetite."
08:48,"Other effects of junk food are dental caries, allergies and cancer."
08:54,Junk food lacks the necessary nutrients to keep our body healthy.
08:59,"Therefore, eating too much junk food can weaken our immune system."
09:05,Due to which we may often feel tired and weak.
09:09,"Usually, we are not aware about the ill effects of junk food on our health."
09:14,Without giving a thought we eat them regularly in large amounts.
09:20,"Therefore, we should be careful about choosing our food so that we stay healthy."
09:27,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thank you for joining."
