00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the complications of using nipple shields.
00:07,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:10,Nipple shields.
00:13,Disadvantages of using nipple shields.
00:16,Suggestions for adequate breastfeeding.
00:20,"Let us begin.A nipple shield is used to help with breastfeeding."
00:26,"It is a nipple-shaped cover made of plastic,"
00:30,"silicon,latex or other materials."
00:36,"While breastfeeding, it is positioned over the nipple and areola."
00:42,It is a temporary solution to help the baby latch on to the mother’s nipple.
00:48,Nipple shields are usually recommended to mothers who have flat nipples.
00:55,They are also recommended to mothers who have inverted nipples.
01:01,They are also used when the baby doesn’t latch on or suck the breast properly.
01:08,Mothers with cracked nipples also use them to avoid pain.
01:14,"However, use of nipple shields during breastfeeding has many disadvantages."
01:22,They create a barrier between the infant and the mother’s breast.
01:28,They make breastfeeding feel unnatural.
01:32,They reduce the stimulation of the areola.
01:36,This may interfere with prolactin and oxytocin release in the mother.
01:43,Prolactin and oxytocin are hormones needed for lactation.
01:49,Prolactin helps in breast milk production.
01:54,Oxytocin helps in releasing milk out of the mother’s breast.
02:00,"Therefore, nipple shields reduce breast milk supply during breastfeeding."
02:08,This increases the overall time taken for breastfeeding.
02:13,The mother and the baby feel tired after feed.
02:19,"On long time use, the infant becomes dependent on nipple shields."
02:25,Infants may refuse to breastfeed without a nipple shield.
02:31,This dependency combined with reduced breastmilk supply is not good.
02:38,"Over time, it decreases breast milk production."
02:43,"Therefore, it causes early weaning."
02:47,Early weaning is found among many mothers who use nipple shields.
02:53,Nipple shields prevent the nipple from reaching deep inside the baby’s mouth.
03:01,This does not let the baby deeply attach to the mother’s breast.
03:06,This might also interfere with the baby learning to suckle correctly.
03:13,The baby’s suckling pattern is changed when a nipple shield is used.
03:20,Nipple shields increase the baby’s sucking speed.
03:25,They also increase the baby’s time spent resting during breastfeeding.
03:33,The baby might swallow too much air because of the nipple shield.
03:39,Nipple shields often fall off the breast thereby interrupting breastfeeding.
03:45,Nipple shields give a feeling of inconvenience to the mother and the baby.
03:52,It is difficult for the mother to clean them later after use.
03:58,Hence they increase the chances of passing the infection to the baby.
04:05,A nipple shield with an improper hole gives poor flow of milk.
04:11,This can tire the infant and cause poor growth.
04:16,Sometimes nipple shields of improper size or fit are used.
04:23,They can cause choking in infants.
04:26,They can also cause or worsen cracked nipples in the mother.
04:33,Nipple injury from squeezing of the nipple and areola is possible.
04:40,Nipple shields should not be recommended if the baby is not sucking properly.
04:47,The current research does not yet show safe practices for using nipple shields.
04:55,Some experts recommend nipple shields when the baby refuses to breastfeed.
05:02,Causes for refusal may include flat or inverted nipples.
05:08,They also include premature birth.
05:12,Another cause is the baby not sucking the mother’s breast properly.
05:18,Other causes are neuromuscular issues or
05:22,imprinting.
05:24,Imprinting is a behaviour that happens in the early hours of life.
05:30,"Ideally, the baby naturally attaches to the mother's breast after birth."
05:37,"However, without early breastfeeding, the baby attaches to something else."
05:44,"It could be a thumb, bottle, plastic nipple, etc."
05:49,This causes the baby to refuse to breastfeed.
05:54,"Sometimes, a mother may be stressed."
05:58,She may be considering bottle feeding.
06:01,"In such cases, nipple shields may provide temporary relief to her."
06:08,They may also prevent bottle feeding.
06:12,She must be helped by a lactation expert properly.
06:17,Some mothers may wish to use nipple shields for longer periods.
06:23,"However, they must go for regular follow-ups to check if the shield is helpful."
06:30,"Here, the risk of the baby not feeding directly from the breast is high."
06:37,Self-made nipple shields should not be used.
06:41,Nipple shields should not be altered for use.
06:45,"Sometimes, a mother may ask about using a nipple shield."
06:50,It is important to first ask her about her breastfeeding technique and problems.
06:57,Enquire about her breastfeeding history.
07:01,Enquire about her attempts to correct the baby’s breast sucking technique.
07:08,Then offer suggestions to correct the mother’s breastfeeding technique.
07:14,Nipple shields should only be initiated by a healthcare provider.
07:20,They should be an expert in breastfeeding skills.
07:24,They should thoroughly assess the benefits and risks of using a nipple shield.
07:31,They should also plan with the mother for regular follow-ups while using it.
07:37,Babies can get used to breastfeeding with a nipple shield.
07:42,"Later, they may refuse to breastfeed directly from the breast, without a shield."
07:49,They may also not be able to attach deeply to the mother’s breast later.
07:56,"Therefore, follow-up is especially important in the first 48 hours."
08:02,Mother should be helped to wean from the use of a nipple shield.
08:08,Some healthcare providers cannot help the mother appropriately.
08:13,They should refer her to a lactation expert.
08:17,Mothers should always be taught the proper techniques of breastfeeding.
08:22,"She should know that babies must attach to the lower areola, not to the nipple."
08:30,So it is not mandatory to have a protruded nipple for the baby to attach.
08:37,"Most often, the nipple can protrude naturally with the help of deep latching."
08:44,This happens over a few days due to good sucking by the deeply latched infant.
08:51,The use of nipple shields can make this natural process difficult.
08:57,Initiating breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth is important.
09:03,"To do so, skin-to-skin contact must be performed immediately after birth."
09:10,Skin-to-skin contact after birth is explained in another tutorial.
09:16,Mother should also learn the correct techniques of breastfeeding.
09:21,Cross-cradle hold is one of them.
09:25,This hold will help in adequate breastfeeding even if the mother has flat nipples.
09:33,"In this hold, the mother's fingers on the breast are parallel to the baby’s lips."
09:40,This helps the baby latch deeply to the breast.
09:44,Cross-cradle hold is explained in another tutorial of the same series.
09:50,Patience in learning breastfeeding skills must be encouraged.
09:56,Repeated attempts must be made to breastfeed without a nipple shield.
10:02,"Remember, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is crucial."
10:09,Breastfeeding must be effective for the baby’s growth.
10:14,Correct breastfeeding techniques will ensure that the baby gets enough milk.
10:20,Any artificial product can never replace natural breastfeeding.
10:26,An expert must always guide a mother to learn proper breastfeeding skills.
10:33,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
