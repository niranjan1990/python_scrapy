Time,Narration
00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of potassium.
00:05,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:08,Health benefits of potassium.
00:12,Causes of it’s deficiency.
00:15,Recommended daily intake of potassium.
00:19,Food sources.
00:22,Potassium is an essential type 2 nutrient.
00:26,It is required for normal functioning of cells.
00:31,It is also one of the important electrolytes.
00:36,Potassium’s main role is to maintain the normal levels of fluid inside the cell.
00:43,While sodium maintains the fluid level outside the cells.
00:49,Potassium regulates heartbeat and supports normal blood pressure.
00:55,It ensures proper functioning of muscles and nerves.
01:01,It contributes towards protein synthesis and
01:05,carbohydrate metabolism.
01:08,We will now see the effects of sugar and sodium on blood pressure.
01:14,"On eating food high in sugar and salt, our sodium level increases."
01:21,Sugar enhances sodium absorption in the body by the kidney.
01:27,"As a result, sodium gets retained in the body."
01:32,This causes an increase in blood pressure and
01:36,water retention in the body.
01:39,"As a result, puffiness in hands and feet can be seen."
01:44,It is recommended to avoid sugar intake
01:48,and increase potassium intake.
01:52,Potassium relaxes the blood vessels and removes excess sodium.
01:58,Thereby the blood pressure reduces.
02:02,"Remember that each day, our body requires more potassium than sodium."
02:09,I will discuss the recommended dietary allowance later in this tutorial.
02:15,There are various factors that cause increased deficiency of potassium.
02:21,A diet which is low in potassium is one of them.
02:27,Some medicines can cause removal of a lot of potassium from the body.
02:33,This factor also causes deficiency of potassium.
02:39,Frequent vomiting and diarrhea can also lead to deficiency.
02:44,"In such cases, along with potassium, the body also loses chloride and sodium."
02:52,Deficiency of magnesium also causes potassium deficiency.
02:58,Kidneys need magnesium to reabsorb potassium.
03:04,This helps in maintaining normal levels of potassium in cells.
03:11,People with pica are also at the risk of potassium deficiency.
03:17,Pica is an intake of inedible substances like clay or soil.
03:25,Clay binds with potassium and increases potassium excretion from the body.
03:31,This can lead to the deficiency of the mineral in the body.
03:37,Inflammation in the intestine can decrease the absorption of potassium.
03:43,This factor also causes deficiency of potassium.
03:48,Low potassium intake impairs calcium reabsorption in the kidney.
03:55,This leads to increased calcium excretion in the urine
03:59,and causes kidney stones.
04:03,"Early symptoms of deficiency include fatigue,"
04:07,muscle weakness and
04:09,cramps.
04:11,Irregular heart beat is another example.
04:16,Loss of potassium happens due to impaired glucose metabolism.
04:22,Sudden loss of potassium can increase blood sugar level.
04:27,The deficiency causes growth retardation and
04:31,decreased levels of growth hormone.
04:35,Growth hormone helps in the formation of new cells and
04:40,stimulates growth.
04:42,Severe deficiency can cause high blood pressure and mental confusion.
04:49,High blood pressure is one of the major causes for heart diseases and stroke.
04:56,"Like deficiency, increase in the level of potassium also causes health issues."
05:03,Increase in the level of potassium in the blood can be fatal.
05:09,There are various factors that cause increased levels of potassium in blood.
05:16,Certain medication for kidney ailments is one of the reasons.
05:21,Using potassium based salt substitutes also increases potassium in blood.
05:28,Eating a high potassium diet with existing kidney issues is another risk factor.
05:37,I will discuss the food sources of potassium in the later part of this tutorial.
05:43,The symptoms of increased potassium in the body are weakness
05:48,and fatigue.
05:50,"Nausea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing and chest pain are other symptoms."
05:59,Recommended intake of potassium differs for different age groups.
06:05,"1 to 3 year old requires around 1,100 milligrams per day."
06:14,"4 to 6 year old require about 1,550 milligrams per day."
06:22,"For men, it is 3,750 milligrams per day."
06:29,"For women, it is around 3,225 milligrams per day."
06:36,I will now tell you about the vast food sources of potassium.
06:42,It is naturally present in all plant based foods.
06:47,"Pulses, legumes, nuts, seeds and spices are the richest sources."
06:57,"Vegetables, fruits, grains and milk also have potassium."
07:05,30 grams of raw green gram has approximately 353 milligrams of potassium.
07:14,30 grams of raw soybean has around 490 milligrams.
07:20,30 grams of raw split red gram has approximately 419 milligrams.
07:29,30 grams split black gram has around 347 milligrams.
07:36,20 grams of almonds have approximately 140 milligrams.
07:43,20 grams of cashew nuts have approximately 127 milligrams.
07:50,10 grams of sesame seeds have around 46 milligrams.
07:56,10 grams of sunflower seeds have approximately 56 milligrams of potassium.
08:04,100 grams of spinach has around 625 milligrams of potassium.
08:12,100 grams of amaranth leaves have approximately 572 milligrams.
08:19,100 grams of orange has nearly 164 milligrams.
08:26,100 grams of guava has around 283 milligrams of potassium.
08:33,250 ml of milk has approximately 260 milligrams of potassium.
08:41,Likewise some spices and condiments have high amounts of potassium.
08:48,5 grams of turmeric powder has around 118 milligrams.
08:55,5 grams of fenugreek seeds have around 46 milligrams.
09:01,5 grams of red chilli powder has around 112 milligrams.
09:08,5 grams of black pepper seeds have approximately 74 milligrams.
09:15,5 grams of coriander seeds has around 74 milligrams.
09:22,Include these potassium rich food regularly for good health and wellbeing.
09:29,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
