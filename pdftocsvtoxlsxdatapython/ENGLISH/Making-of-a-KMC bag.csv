00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the making of a kangaroo bag with an attached cap.
00:09,"In this tutorial, we will learn-"
00:11,The benefits of a kangaroo bag.
00:15,The procedure of making a kangaroo bag with an attached cap.
00:21,Let us begin.
00:24,A kangaroo bag is used to provide kangaroo mother care or KMC.
00:33,Kangaroo mother care has been explained in another tutorial of the same series.
00:40,A kangaroo bag makes KMC convenient for the mother.
00:47,Mothers have a unique natural mechanism to maintain the baby’s body temperature.
00:55,It works by changing the blood circulation specifically between the breasts.
01:03,This happens when there is skin-to-skin contact between the mother and baby.
01:11,This skin-to-skin contact is made easier and sustainable by a kangaroo bag.
01:20,This bag also keeps the mother’s hands free while providing KMC.
01:27,It distributes the weight of the baby evenly on the mother’s chest.
01:35,"Therefore, it prevents backache."
01:39,A kangaroo bag is always made with an attached cap.
01:45,Newborn babies lose heat from their head.
01:50,The attached cap covers the baby’s head and prevents loss of heat.
01:58,It is important to make at least 2 kangaroo bags for a mother.
02:04,She can use the 2nd bag when the 1st bag needs to be washed and dried.
02:12,"To make 2 kangaroo bags, you will need:"
02:16,1.5 meters of soft flannel cloth.
02:21,A pair of scissors.
02:23,A sewing machine.
02:25,A cloth chalk or marker.
02:28,A measuring tape.
02:31,Soft flannel cloth is the best cloth for newborn babies.
02:37,It doesn’t cause irritation to their soft skin.
02:43,It is available in many different colours and designs at local markets.
02:50,The first step is cutting the flannel cloth required to make one bag.
02:58,"For this, open the soft flannel cloth."
03:03,Lay it vertically on a table.
03:07,The printed side or the right side of the cloth should not be visible.
03:14,The plain side or the wrong side should be visible on the upper side.
03:21,Use a measuring tape to measure 60 cm for the length of the bag.
03:29,Mark it with a cloth chalk or a marker.
03:34,Measure 30 cm for the width of the bag.
03:40,Mark it with a cloth chalk or a marker.
03:44,Cut the cloth along the marked lines using a scissor.
03:50,"Now, we have a 60 cm by 30 cm cloth piece ready."
03:58,Next step is to fold the cloth for the bottom leg pouch.
04:05,Fold 1 cm of the lower edge of the cloth horizontally.
04:11,This is required later for hemming.
04:16,"Then, fold the cloth horizontally up to 15 cm for the length of the pouch."
04:25,Measure 15 cm after folding it.
04:30,Next step is to cut the openings in the pouch for the baby's legs.
04:37,"Without opening the 15 cm pouch fold, fold the cloth vertically in half."
04:46,The plain side or the wrong side should be outside after folding the cloth.
04:53,Measure 8 cm in length from the top of the 15 cm pouch fold.
05:02,Mark it on the side of the cloth that is open.
05:07,Measure 8 cm in breadth at the bottom from the folded side of the cloth.
05:15,Mark it with a cloth chalk or a marker.
05:20,Connect the 2 markings by drawing a curve.
05:25,Cut the cloth along the curve using a scissor.
05:30,"Now, open the vertical fold."
05:34,Fold it vertically in half with the printed side outside.
05:41,Do not open the horizontal pouch fold.
05:46,Align and hold the 4 layers of cloth together along the curve.
05:53,Cut any extra cloth to make the curve of the leg openings smoother.
06:00,This completes the cutting of the pouch of the kangaroo bag.
06:05,Keep it aside.
06:08,Next step is to cut the cloth for making belts.
06:14,A kangaroo bag has 3 belts.
06:19,One belt goes around the neck of the mother.
06:24,The other two belts are tied to each other at the waist of the mother.
06:31,We will use the remaining flannel cloth to cut these belts.
06:37,Measure and mark 80 cm for the length of a belt.
06:43,Measure and mark 6 cm for its breadth.
06:49,Cut 3 such belts.
06:53,Keep them aside.
06:56,Next step is to cut the cloth for a cap
07:01,"From the remaining flannel cloth, measure 30 cms for the length of the cap."
07:08,Mark it with a cloth chalk or a marker.
07:13,Measure and mark 15 cm for the breadth of the cap.
07:20,Cut the cloth along the marked lines using a scissor.
07:26,"Now, we have a 30 cm by 15 cm cloth piece ready for the cap."
07:35,"Now, we will learn how to sew the cap."
07:39,Fold the cap cloth piece horizontally in half at the midline.
07:46,The plain side or the wrong side should be outside after folding the cloth.
07:54,Sew the edges of 2 layers of cloth together on either side of the fold.
08:01,Hem the other two sides of the cloth.
08:06,"Now, the cap is ready to be attached to the bag."
08:11,Keep it aside.
08:14,Next step is to sew the 3 belts for the kangaroo bag.
08:21,"First, fold the belts vertically 1.5 cm from the left."
08:28,"Then, fold them vertically 1.5 cm from the right."
08:35,The printed or the right side should be visible after folding the belts.
08:42,"Now, fold the belts vertically a little less than half, near the midline."
08:50,The previous 2 folds from the right and left should be hidden inside this fold.
08:58,Folding thrice will make the belts strong enough to hold the baby’s weight.
09:06,"Now, sew them straight along the third fold."
09:11,Sew back and forth along the fold thrice to add extra strength.
09:18,Belts are ready.
09:20,Keep them aside.
09:22,"Next, we will learn how to sew the pouch of the bag."
09:27,This is a picture of the pouch cloth piece that we had cut.
09:34,Hem the C shaped curves on the right and left sides of this cloth.
09:40,"Next, hem the upper horizontal edge of the pouch."
09:46,Fold it twice before sewing.
09:50,The second fold should be bigger than the first one.
09:55,The pouch is ready.
09:59,Next step is to attach the belts to the pouch.
10:04,Fold the pouch horizontally.
10:07,The plain or wrong side of the cloth should be outside.
10:13,Place a belt between the top corner of the pouch and the cloth below.
10:21,Sew the 3 layers together leaving half an inch space from the side.
10:29,Sew back and forth 3 times to ensure that the belt is attached properly.
10:37,"Similarly, sew the second belt on the other top corner of the pouch."
10:44,"In this picture, the pouch is ready and the belts are attached to it."
10:51,Next step is to attach the cap and the third belt.
10:56,Start hemming the two sides of the remaining cloth above the pouch.
11:03,Do not hem the entire length of the cloth.
11:08,Stop about half an inch before reaching the top end.
11:14,Place an end of the belt at the printed side of the top end of the cloth.
11:21,Place a corner of the cap over the same end of the belt.
11:27,Align and hold the 3 layers together.
11:32,Fold the layers on the upper end tightly.
11:37,"Then, sew them together 2 to 3 times."
11:42,"Now, attach the cap to the cloth along the horizontal edge."
11:48,The breadth of the cap may be more than that of the cloth.
11:54,"If it is, then make a small pleat in the cap cloth."
12:01,Hold the pleat while sewing to align both layers of cloth properly.
12:08,"Now, place the other end of the belt at the other end of the cloth."
12:15,Place the other corner of the cap over the belt.
12:20,Align and hold the 3 layers together.
12:25,Fold the layers on the upper end tightly.
12:30,"Then, sew them together 2 to 3 times."
12:36,Hem the remaining vertical edge of the cloth if you did not do it before.
12:43,"Lastly, cut all the extra threads."
12:48,The kangaroo bag with an attached cap is ready.
12:54,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
