Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the nutrient count of day to day food.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,Importance of nutrition.
00:11,Nutrient count of some day to day food.
00:16,Nutrition is important for good health.
00:20,Essential nutrition is necessary from infancy for growth
00:25,and development.
00:27,It also helps to prevent malnutrition.
00:31,Poor nutrition can lead to impaired mental and physical development.
00:37,It can also lead to reduced immunity.
00:41,Reduced immunity increases the risk of developing minor and chronic diseases.
00:49,Nutrition related problems can be prevented by breastfeeding a baby.
00:56,Remember that a baby should be breastfed within the first hour of its birth.
01:03,Exclusive breastfeeding till 6 months with correct techniques is important.
01:10,"After 6 months along with breastmilk, nutrient dense food should be given."
01:17,This nutrient dense food is called complementary food.
01:23,Complementary food should be rich in all the nutrients.
01:28,Protein is one of the important nutrients.
01:33,It helps in growth and development.
01:37,"Hence, it is advised to include protein rich food sources in daily diet."
01:44,"Milk and milk products,"
01:47,"beans,nuts"
01:49,and seeds are good sources of protein.
01:53,"Eggs, fish, chicken and meat are also excellent sources."
02:00,Absorption of protein from non-vegetarian food is higher than vegetarian food.
02:06,It is because non-vegetarian foods have complete proteins.
02:12,Complete proteins contain all the essential amino acids.
02:17,More about the importance of protein has been explained in another tutorial.
02:24,Please visit our website for this tutorial.
02:28,Let’s take a look at the protein content of some of the food sources.
02:34,100 grams of fish has about 21 grams of protein.
02:40,250 millilitres of cows milk has approximately 8 grams of protein.
02:47,1 whole egg has around 7 grams.
02:52,30 grams of soybean has 11 grams.
02:56,Whereas 30 grams of all raw pulses have around 4 grams of protein.
03:04,Let us look at the nutrient count of some day to day food.
03:09,"Please note, 1 medium bowl mentioned in this tutorial is 150 millilitres."
03:17,1 tablespoon is 20 grams.
03:21,The nutritive values mentioned are approximate values.
03:27,I will briefly tell you the nutrient value of cooked rice.
03:33,1⁄2 medium bowl of cooked rice has 22 grams of carbohydrates.
03:40,It has only 2 grams of protein.
03:44,It has 1 gram of fibre.
03:48,2 milligrams of calcium and no iron.
03:54,Now Let’s see the nutritional value of a common meal.
03:59,"For example, 1⁄2 medium size bowl of cooked rice with chicken curry."
04:06,1⁄2 bowl chicken curry will have 100 grams of boneless chicken or 4 small pieces.
04:15,Another example is 1⁄2 medium size bowl of curd rice.

04:27,Protein increases upto 10 times when cooked rice is taken with 1⁄2 bowl chicken curry.
04:35,It increases iron from 0 to 1 milligram.
04:42,"When combined with 100 grams of curd, protein increases to 3 grams."
04:49,There is a 100 times rise in calcium content.
04:55,"Similarly, cooked rice with 1⁄2 bowl kidney beans curry will have 4 times more protein."
05:04,1⁄2 bowl of kidney beans curry will have 30 grams of kidney beans.
05:11,Fibre will increase to 7 grams and
05:15,iron to 2 milligrams.

05:27,1⁄2 bowl fish curry will have 100 grams of fish or 2 small pieces.
05:35,It increases calcium from 2 to 45 milligrams.
05:41,"Similarly, 1⁄2 bowl of prawns curry increases protein from 2 to 16 grams."
05:49,1⁄2 bowl of prawns curry will have 50 grams or 3 to 4 pieces of prawns.
05:58,Calcium increases to 47 milligrams from 2 milligrams.
06:04,1⁄2 bowl of lentils with cooked rice increases protein upto 6 times.
06:12,1⁄2 bowl lentils will have 30 grams of lentils.
06:17,Fibre increases to 11 grams and
06:20,iron to 2 milligrams.
06:24,Now I will tell you the nutritive value of one chapati made from wheat.
06:31,A six inch chapati has around 16 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of protein.
06:40,"It has around 3 grams fibre, 9 milligrams calcium and 1 milligram iron."
06:48,When consumed with 2 scrambled eggs the protein increases to 16 grams.
06:56,Iron improves to 3 milligrams and calcium to 69 milligrams.
07:03,Chapati with 1⁄2 bowl of bengal gram curry raises protein from 3 grams to 9 grams.
07:11,1⁄2 bowl of bengal gram curry will have 30 grams of bengal gram.
07:18,Fibre increases to 11 grams and iron to 5 milligrams.

08:24,"They have 2 grams fibre, 7 milligrams calcium and 0.5 milligram iron."
08:34,Let us see how sambar and sesame peanut chutney improves the nutrient count.
08:42,1⁄2 bowl of thick sambar will have 30 grams of split pigeon pea.
08:49,1⁄2 medium bowl of thick sambar with idli doubles the protein content.

12:17,There is an increase in fibre upto 6 grams.
12:23,"Sorghum roti with 1⁄2 bowl chicken curry, improves the protein to 21 grams."

12:37,It is advised to combine 2 or 3 food groups in a meal.
12:44,"Combine seeds, nuts, and beans in a meal to improve the nutritional quality."
12:51,"For example, adding seeds and coconut paste to chickpea curry."
