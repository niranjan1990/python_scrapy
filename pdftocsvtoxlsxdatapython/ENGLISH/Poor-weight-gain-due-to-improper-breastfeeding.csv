00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on poor weight gain due to improper breastfeeding.
00:09,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:12,The breastfeeding related reasons why a baby does not get enough breast milk.
00:20,Recommended solutions for those reasons.
00:26,Poor weight gain in babies from birth to 6 months of age has one main cause.
00:34,It is that the baby does not get enough breastmilk.
00:40,There are many reasons why a baby may not get enough breast milk.
00:47,They are divided into 4 categories.
00:52,The first category is breastfeeding factors.
00:57,The second category is the mother’s psychological factors.
01:04,The third category is the mother’s physical condition.
01:10,The fourth category is the baby’s physical condition.
01:16,"In this tutorial, we will discuss some of the breastfeeding factors."
01:23,The other 3 categories are explained in another tutorial.
01:29,Delayed start of breastfeeding is the first breastfeeding factor.
01:35,It should start within an hour of birth.
01:40,Doing so will help the baby to learn deep attachment to the breast.
01:47,Pregnant women must be trained in breastfeeding skills in their last trimester.
01:55,Skin-to-skin contact after birth is essential to start breastfeeding.
02:02,It is explained in other tutorials in the same series.
02:08,The 2nd breastfeeding factor is poor positioning of the baby.
02:14,Mother should not bend the baby’s neck forward.
02:19,This happens when the baby’s nose is positioned above the nipple.
02:26,Nostrils of the baby’s nose should always be in line with the nipple.
02:34,"As adults, we extend our necks by tilting our heads backwards to drink water."
02:43,"Similarly, the baby’s neck must be extended to drink milk."
02:50,Mother can pull the baby more towards the other breast to extend its neck.
02:58,Mother should not turn the baby’s neck sideways.
03:03,This will make it difficult for the baby to swallow milk.
03:09,Baby's chest and tummy should be lightly pressed into the mother's chest.
03:16,Baby should be facing the breast and
03:19,not the mother’s face while feeding.
03:23,"In this picture, the baby's face is positioned correctly in the cross cradle hold."
03:31,Baby’s upper lip is at the 9 O'clock position on the right breast.
03:38,Baby’s lower lip is at the 3 O'clock position.
03:44,Baby’s legs should be tucked well under the mother’s arm.
03:50,"Otherwise, the baby will slip down causing nipple feeding."
03:57,Baby’s hip can be seated in the fold of the mother’s elbow.
04:03,This will prevent the baby from slipping down.
04:08,The 3rd breastfeeding factor is poor attachment of the baby to the breast.
04:16,Mother must wait for at least 2 to 3 minutes till the baby opens its mouth widely.
04:25,It should be open between 120 and 160 degrees wide.
04:32,Only then should the mother put her breast in the baby’s mouth.
04:38,Baby's lips and chin should never be far from the areola.
04:45,Baby’s mouth should be deeply pressed into the mother’s breast.
04:51,"Otherwise, dimples will appear in the baby’s cheeks when it sucks milk."
04:58,Dimples in the cheeks also appear when there is nipple latching.
05:05,Another cause of dimples is when more of the upper areola is in the baby’s mouth.
05:14,Mother’s fingers compressing the breast should be parallel to the baby’s lips.
05:21,This will ensure that a big part of lower areola goes into the baby's mouth.
05:29,"If the baby sucks only the nipple, it will never get enough milk."
05:36,Deep attachment to the breast is very important.
05:41,It is important to check if the baby’s attachment to the breast is deep.
05:49,"To do so, the mother can press the breast near the baby’s lower lip."
05:56,The entire lower part of the areola must be in the baby’s mouth while feeding.
06:04,Baby’s upper lip should be just above the mother’s nipple.
06:10,Baby’s lower lip should be at the border of the areola.
06:16,"If the areola is small, baby’s lower lip should be on the breast."
06:23,This will help the baby get enough milk.
06:28,Deep attachment to the breast is explained in another tutorial.
06:34,The 4th breastfeeding factor is the mother not feeding hindmilk to the baby.
06:42,Baby must be fed the thick hindmilk that comes after feeding the foremilk.
06:50,It is rich in good fats that are essential for the baby’s brain and
06:56,growth.
06:58,Not giving hindmilk will result in poor weight gain.
07:04,Mother can check whether the baby has been fed hindmilk.
07:10,"To do so, she can express her milk by hand."
07:15,"If thin milk comes out, then the baby has not got hindmilk yet."
07:23,The mother should continue to feed from the same breast.
07:29,"Also, she may see a good flow of thick milk when she expresses milk."
07:37,This is another sign to continue feeding from the same breast.
07:43,The 5th breastfeeding factor is feeding at fixed times.
07:50,Breastfeeding cannot be scheduled like adult meals.
07:56,The baby must be fed according to its early hunger cues.
08:02,"Early hunger cues are sucking fingers,"
08:05,"turning its head from side to side, etc."
08:11,The mother must recognise these cues and feed the baby immediately.
08:18,She should not wait till the baby starts crying as crying is a late hunger cue.
08:27,The 6th breastfeeding factor is not feeding enough times.
08:34,The baby must be breastfed at least 10 to 12 times in 24 hours.
08:42,The maximum frequency depends on the baby’s hunger cues.
08:49,"Sometimes, the baby may want to have milk several times in 1 hour."
08:57,The baby must be fed as many times as it wants.
09:02,The 7th breastfeeding factor is not feeding at night.
09:09,Prolactin levels in a lactating mother are higher at night.
09:16,Prolactin is a hormone that helps in the production of breastmilk.
09:23,Not feeding at night will reduce breastmilk supply.
09:29,"So, babies must be breastfed at least 3 to 4 times during the night."
09:37,Sometimes the baby doesn’t wake up for more than 3 hours at night.
09:44,The mother must wake the baby up for breastfeeding.
09:50,She can do this by tickling the baby’s feet
09:54,or the baby’s back.
09:58,She can also wake the baby up by making it sit.
10:04,The 8th breastfeeding factor is the short duration of breastfeeding.
10:11,The baby must be fed as long as it wants to feed.
10:16,Mother should not take the baby off the breast if the baby is feeding.
10:23,"Only when the baby shows signs of fullness, the mother should stop feeding."
10:30,"Fullness signs are closing its mouth,"
10:33,"turning its head away from the breast, etc."
10:38,The 9th breastfeeding factor is the baby falling asleep while feeding.
10:45,"In the first few weeks of breastfeeding, the baby may sleep off while feeding."
10:52,This leads to inadequate milk intake.
10:57,"As mentioned earlier, the mother should immediately wake the baby up."
11:04,She must keep waking the baby up and feeding until the baby refuses to feed.
11:11,The 10th breastfeeding factor is not offering both breasts to the baby.
11:18,Some mothers feed the baby from one breast and never offer the other breast.
11:26,Mother must offer the other breast to the baby after one breast is emptied.
11:34,The baby will decide whether it wants to feed on the other breast.
11:41,"The 11th breastfeeding factor is using feeding bottles,"
11:45,"nipple shields, etc."
11:49,This doesn’t let the baby naturally attach deeply to the mother’s breast.
11:57,"To avoid them, the mother must be taught the correct breastfeeding technique."
12:04,The last breastfeeding factor is giving other food or fluids to the baby.
12:12,Baby must be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life.
12:19,Other fluids or food are not as safe
12:22,and nutritious as breast milk.
12:27,They may cause infections.
12:31,They will also fill the baby’s tummy.
12:35,"Therefore, the baby will not feel hungry to have mother’s milk."
12:42,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
