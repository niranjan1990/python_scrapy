00:01,"Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of the 1st 1,000 days of life."
00:08,"In this tutorial, we will discuss the benefits of good nutrition during these days."
00:15,"Also, we will learn how to nourish a baby during these days."
00:21,Some key topics mentioned in this tutorial are explained in other tutorials.
00:27,Please visit our website for more details.
00:31,"Let us 1st understand what are the 1st 1,000 days of life."
00:37,"The 1st 1,000 days of life start on the 1st day of pregnancy."
00:43,They end on a child’s 2nd birthday.
00:48,"How well a child grows in these 1,000 days decides the future."
00:55,"If nourished well, the child can have a healthy future."
01:00,Good nutrition is necessary for a child’s early development.
01:05,"It plays a foundational role in enabling a child to grow, learn and succeed."
01:13,"Let’s discuss the role of nutrition at every stage in the 1st 1,000 days."
01:20,The 1st stage is pregnancy.
01:24,The brain of the fetus begins to grow from the 3rd week of pregnancy.
01:31,"Thereafter, it develops at a very high speed during the entire pregnancy."
01:38,Most of the mothers are not even aware of their pregnancy during this time.
01:45,"Therefore, all women in their reproductive age should consume nutritious food."
01:52,It is especially important for women planning a pregnancy.
01:58,"Healthy lifestyle, body fat and muscle percentage before pregnancy are crucial."
02:06,Adolescent and pre-pregnancy nutrition is explained in other tutorials.
02:13,Please visit our website for more details.
02:17,"During the 3rd trimester, the brain cells begin to be covered by a layer of fat."
02:25,It is called the myelin sheath.
02:29,This helps in passing the messages through the brain cells quickly.
02:35,"By 7th month, brain of a fetus takes on a form that resembles an adult’s brain."
02:43,"In the 7th, 8th and 9th months, there is a rapid growth of the fetus’s brain."
02:51,This rapid growth is not possible without one thing.
02:57,It is the nutrition that a baby gets from the mother’s diet.
03:03,Mother’s diet decides the baby’s body fat and muscle percentage.
03:10,It also decides the baby’s food preferences.
03:15,Mother should consume a variety of nutrient-dense local seasonal foods.
03:23,"Adequate amounts of iron, folate and calcium should be present in her body."
03:30,Consumption of iodine sources is necessary during pregnancy.
03:36,"She must eat adequate protein, good fats and essential nutrients."
03:44,Sources of these nutrients are given in other tutorials of the same series.
03:51,"Otherwise, vital brain development processes can be impaired."
03:56,The baby could also have birth defects and cognitive defects.
04:03,A well-known example is neural tube defects.
04:08,"Folate, B12 and choline are needed for early development of the brain and spine."
04:16,Mother must take sufficient folate during pre-pregnancy.
04:22,She should take it in the early weeks of pregnancy as well.
04:28,"Otherwise, the development of the neural tube can go wrong."
04:34,It leads to birth defects of the brain and spine.
04:39,The rate of a mother’s weight gain during pregnancy decides the baby’s health.
04:46,High weight gain in mothers who are not underweight is not good.
04:52,It increases the risk of childhood obesity.
04:57,Obesity during pregnancy puts women at risk for gestational diabetes.
05:05,This increases the baby’s risk to be obese
05:08,and diabetic later in life.
05:13,A mother’s lifestyle during pregnancy also plays an important role.
05:19,"Severe stress, depression or violence during pregnancy must be avoided."
05:27,Such negative experiences can deeply affect a developing fetus.
05:34,Smoking can cause low birth weight or premature delivery.
05:40,It can also increase the baby’s risk of obesity later in life.
05:48,Alcohol and tobacco should not be consumed.
05:53,Diseases should be prevented or treated immediately to minimise nutrient loss.
06:02,"After the 270 days of pregnancy, infancy is the 2nd stage of the 1st 1,000 days."
06:11,"During infancy, the child’s brain develops motor functions such as balance."
06:20,It also develops the ability to create new memories and remember them later.
06:28,"At this stage, proper newborn care is required."
06:33,Newborn care is explained in detail in other tutorials in the same series.
06:41,Breastmilk is the best food for a newborn’s brain development.
06:47,"It contains a variety of nutrients, growth factors and hormones."
06:54,It is made up of unique components for each mother and her baby.
07:01,No formula milk available in the market can be the same as mother’s milk.
07:08,Its impact on brain development is incomparable.
07:13,Mother’s milk has a high level of DHA and EPA.
07:19,They are important for brain development of the baby.
07:24,Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months has many benefits.
07:30,Breastfeeding is associated with an increase in IQ.
07:36,It is also associated with getting more education and earning a better income.
07:44,This is true for children and adolescents across all income levels.
07:51,This brain development is not just because of breastmilk.
07:56,The experience of breastfeeding also contributes to it.
08:02,Breastfeeding involves plenty of mother-child interaction and nurturing.
08:09,It helps in strengthening a baby’s sensory and emotional control.
08:16,These are critical for both cognitive and socio-emotional development.
08:23,"To get these benefits, breastfeeding must be done using the proper technique."
08:29,"Next, let’s discuss brain development in the toddler stage."
08:35,A child’s brain continues to grow and develop at a rapid pace.
08:42,"During toddlerhood, a child’s brain develops the ability to do complex tasks."
08:50,A toddler’s brain is busy forming new connections between the brain cells.
08:56,"At this time, such connections are created faster than at any other time in life."
09:05,This has many benefits.
09:08,It helps the child to learn new things faster.
09:13,It also helps the child to adapt to changing environments and circumstances.
09:21,"In the 2nd year of baby’s life, parts of the brain’s language areas develop."
09:28,This leads to a sharp increase in a child’s language abilities.
09:35,It also develops language learning capacity
09:38,and the ability to learn new skills.
09:43,Nutrition during this period remains critically important.
09:49,"Protein, iron, zinc and iodine are essential to the toddler’s developing brain."
09:57,"Other important nutrients are DHA, EPA, choline, B12, etc."
10:07,"Iron plays a significant role in brain development throughout the 1st 1,000 days."
10:14,"Damage caused due to iron deficiency in these 1,000 days can be irreversible."
10:23,It leads to impaired learning and socio-emotional behaviour.
10:29,"This includes:Less social interaction and alertness."
10:33,Increased irritability.
10:35,Increased cautiousness.
10:38,Less interest in indoor and outdoor games.
10:43,This can reduce the amount of attention and interaction given by caregivers.
10:51,This further contributes to the poor development of the child.
10:56,Iron deficiency also appears to affect the chemical substances in the brain.
11:03,It is associated with higher levels of anxiety
11:07,and depression later in life.
11:11,It impacts consequent job potential.
11:16,Toddlers need to be fed iron rich foods.
11:21,"Otherwise, they are unlikely to consume enough iron."
11:26,"Hence, after 6 months of age, complementary feeding is necessary."
11:32,"Damage caused by malnutrition in the 1st 1,000 days is permanent."
11:39,It causes loss of IQ.
11:43,Chronic malnutrition during this critical period leads to stunting.
11:49,Loss of height or stunting in the 1st 2 years of life cannot be reversed.
11:57,It affects the child’s future generations too.
12:02,Malnourished women give birth to malnourished sons and daughters.
12:08,"Later on, these malnourished daughters grow up to become malnourished mothers."
12:15,Therefore they create a continuous cycle of malnourishment.
12:22,It takes 2 to 3 generations to combat stunting in future generations.
12:29,This is why the average height of a 19-year-old woman in India is only 5 feet.
12:38,The average height of a 19-year-old man in India is only 5 feet 4 inches.
12:47,"All this can be prevented by improving nutrition during 1st 1,000 days."
12:54,This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
