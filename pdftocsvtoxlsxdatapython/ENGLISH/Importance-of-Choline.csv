Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of choline.
00:05,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:09,Primary functions of choline.
00:12,Causes and symptoms of its deficiency.
00:17,Requirements for different age groups.
00:21,Choline is an essential nutrient.
00:25,It is required for vital functions in the body
00:29,and for overall health.
00:32,Vital functions like maintaining the cell structure and
00:37,functioning of cells.
00:40,Choline helps in carrying the nerve impulses from neuron to neuron.
00:47,It also helps in carrying impulses from neurons to organs.
00:54,Choline plays a role in normal functioning of the liver.
00:59,Transportation of fat and cholesterol also requires choline.
01:05,"It is involved in muscle control,"
01:09,"memoryand circadian rhythm."
01:13,Circadian rhythm is a process that regulates our sleep and waking up cycle.
01:21,Choline is required during fetal development.
01:25,It is required for brain
01:28,and nervous system development of the baby.
01:32,It influences the closure of the neural tube.
01:37,Neural tube in the embryo forms the brain and spinal cord.
01:43,There are various factors that can cause increase in the deficiency.
01:49,"The metabolism of choline, folate, vitamin B12 and methionine are interrelated."
02:00,"If availability of 1 nutrient is disturbed, other nutrients are also affected."
02:08,Inadequate dietary intake of folate and
02:12,Vitamin B12 causes choline depletion.
02:17,"Apart from these, having a poor diet can cause choline deficiency."
02:24,"During pregnancy and lactation, the requirement of choline increases."
02:30,If these requirements are not met then deficiency occurs.
02:36,This can cause neural tube defects and
02:40,stunting in children.
02:43,Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the nervous system and spine.
02:51,It also affects their brain development.
02:55,Intelligence and motor development also get affected.
03:01,Deficiency in growing children leads to poor memory.
03:06,They will also have difficulty in learning.
03:10,"In adults, choline deficiency can cause damage to the muscle and liver."
03:17,Due to choline deficiency fat does not move out of the liver.
03:23,"This leads to fat accumulation, causing non alcoholic fatty liver disease."
03:31,Choline deficiency can also lead to Alzheimer's disease.
03:36,In Alzheimer’s disease memory and thinking skills are diminished.
03:42,Adequate intake of choline varies for different age groups.
03:48,For 0 to 13 month old infants it is 125 to 150 milligrams per day.
03:57,For 1 to 8 years old children it is 200 to 250 milligrams per day.
04:06,9 to 13 years old require 375 milligrams per day.
04:13,14 to 18 years old need 400 to 550 milligrams per day.
04:22,Adult men require 550 milligrams per day.
04:28,Adult women and pregnant women require 450 milligrams per day.
04:36,Lactating women require 550 milligrams per day.
04:42,Our body does not produce sufficient amounts of choline.
04:47,Hence it has to be taken through food.
04:51,Let us look at the food sources of choline.
04:55,"Eggs,chicken liver,"
04:58,"fish,"
05:00,"wheat germ,"
05:02,"nuts,"
05:04,seeds
05:06,and legumes are good sources.
05:09,Let’s look at the amount of choline present in a few food items.
05:16,1 egg has around 147 milligrams.
05:21,100 grams of chicken liver has approximately 190 milligrams.
05:27,100 grams of salmon has nearly 79 milligrams.
05:34,30 grams of raw split black gram has around 62 milligrams.
05:42,100 grams of cauliflower has 127 milligrams.
05:48,30 grams of soybean has 36 milligrams.
05:54,Include these choline rich food in your daily diet for good health.
06:00,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
