00:00,Welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on Nipple conditions in lactating mothers.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about- sore or cracked nipples and"
00:11,flat or inverted nipples.
00:15,The first nipple condition is- sore or cracked nipples.
00:20,It is a condition where mother develops cracked and bleeding nipples.
00:26,This causes the nipples to become itchy and dry.
00:30,"Now, let’s discuss the various causes of sore or cracked nipples which are-"
00:36,"nipple feeding,"
00:38,"fungal or bacterial infection,"
00:41,habit of cleaning the nipples after every feed and
00:45,baby with tongue tie.
00:47,Let us begin with the nipple feeding.
00:50,Nipple feeding is the first and foremost cause of sore or cracked nipples.
00:56,"During nipple feeding, nipple gets rubbed on to the hard palate of the baby’s mouth."
01:03,Baby pinches this nipple between the hard palate and the tongue.
01:08,This pinching makes the breastfeeding painful and results into sore or cracked nipple.
01:17,Nipple feeding is the result of improper latching.
01:20,"Therefore correct latching plays an important role to avoid sore or cracked nipples due tonipple feeding."
01:28,"Note that we have discussed the correct latching technique in another tutorial of the sameseries."
01:36,"Remember, sore or cracked nipples does hurt during correct latching."
01:43,"If the mother continues with the correct latching technique then slowly and gradually itstops hurting."
01:51,Next is fungal or bacterial infection.
01:55,"If the mother has fungal or bacterial infection, she should consult the doctor."
02:02,"Next, some mothers have a habit of cleaning the nipples before every feed."
02:09,This causes dryness of nipples.
02:12,"Thus, this routine should be avoided."
02:16,"Remember, mother can clean the nipples once during bath."
02:21,"However, once a cracked nipple has developed, mother should clean it after every feed."
02:27,"After cleaning, mother should apply her hind-milk on the wound"
02:32,as hind-milk contains substances that aid in healing and fighting infection.
02:39,"Thus, preventing the organisms from baby's mouth to leak into the crack of the nipple."
02:46,Next is the baby with tongue tie.
02:50,"Tongue tie is a condition in which the tip of the baby’s tongue is attached to the innerbottom part of the mouth."
02:58,It is a very rare condition.
03:01,Nipple feeding is commonly observed in baby with tongue tie.
03:06,"In case, the baby has tongue tie then mere correct latching is not enough and surgery isrequired."
03:16,"Thus, in such cases, mother should always consult the doctor."
03:21,"Now, let’s discuss the treatment for sore or cracked nipples."
03:27,"If a mother has sore or cracked nipples, then the health worker should- examine themother’s breast and nipple,"
03:36,tell the mother to express some breast milk with her hand before breastfeeding.
03:42,It will soften the breast and baby will easily attach.
03:47,"Apart from these, expressing will reduce the risk of infections, nipple fissure and mastitis."
03:55,Then guide the mother to attach her baby correctly to her breast.
04:01,"Remember, breastfeeding frequency is one of the factors which determines the breast milksupply."
04:09,"Therefore, mother should not stop breastfeeding."
04:13,During breastfeeding- she should begin to breastfeed on the side that hurts less.
04:20,"If breastfeeding is still painful then she can express the breast milk using her hand and feedit to the baby with a spoon or a cup."
04:32,"Also, apply few drops of hind-milk onto the affected area after each feed as discussedearlier."
04:41,"Remember, not to use the following on sore or cracked nipples and even on healthy nipples-"
04:49,"soaps, oils, lotions, balms and perfumes."
04:54,They may contain irritants.
04:57,It will worsen the condition if a mother has sore or cracked nipples.
05:03,"In severe conditions, mother should consult the doctor or the health worker."
05:09,"For preventing sore or cracked nipples, start breastfeeding immediately after birth."
05:15,Always make sure that baby is latched on deeply while breastfeeding.
05:22,"The nipple condition that we will discuss next is, flat or inverted nipples."
05:28,Flat nipples are not protruded from the level of the areola.
05:32,"Whereas, inverted nipples are usually pointed in the inward direction."
05:38,"It is very important for the mother to understand the fact that flat or inverted nipple is not ahindrance to breastfeeding."
05:48,"Since, during correct latching, baby latches on to the areola and not on the nipple."
05:55,"Note that in case of flat or inverted nipples, mother requires help in first week of delivery."
06:03,"During this period, health worker should guide the mother about correct latching."
06:08,This will build her confidence.
06:11,"Remember, in case a mother has flat or inverted nipples then the best holds for effectiveattachment are- cross cradle hold,"
06:22,football hold and semi-reclining position.
06:26,"As explained in an earlier tutorial, in any hold, it is of utmost importance that mother shouldhold the breast in the correct manner"
06:37,where baby’s lips and mother’s fingers will be in the same direction.
06:42,Note that incorrect latching will result into sore nipples.
06:47,"Remember, do not use feeding bottles or nipple shields."
06:52,It will make it difficult for a baby to breastfeed from breasts having flat or inverted nipples.
06:59,Mother should provide plenty of skin to skin contact to the baby.
07:04,It helps stimulate oxytocin reflex in the mother and breast milk easily comes out.
07:12,"Always remember, correct latching is the key to deal with most of these nipple conditions."
07:20,This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
