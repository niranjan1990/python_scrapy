00:08,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:11,Factors increasing the consumption of junk food.
00:15,Ways to avoid junk food from our diet.
00:20,"Junk food contains a high amount of sugar, salt, refined fat and refined flour."
00:28,Harmful effects of junk food has been discussed in another tutorial.
00:34,Please visit our website for more details.
00:38,Let us understand the factors that increase the consumption of junk food.
00:45,Junk food has become easily available these days.
00:49,"You can find it in shops,"
00:52,"school canteens,roadside vendors"
00:54,and restaurants.
00:56,Let us look at another reason for the increased consumption of junk food.
01:02,Mothers may be busy with job and household work.
01:06,They may not get time to prepare a proper home made meal for their kids.
01:14,"Instead, they may give them money to buy food from outside."
01:20,"Kids may choose to buy chocolates, ice-creams or chips with that money."
01:26,"Moreover, junk food is often cheaper as compared to healthy meals."
01:33,"For example, a plate of chapatis, lentils and vegetables will cost slightly more."
01:42,"Therefore, people may choose something cheap such as samosa, chips, biscuits."
01:50,"Sometimes, parents ignore the child’s likes and dislikes."
01:56,Children often get bored with traditional homemade meals.
02:01,"Due to a lack of variety in homemade meals, they may want to eat junk food."
02:08,They may find these food tastier.
02:11,"On eating junk food high in sugar, the brain releases chemicals like dopamine."
02:19,It is released in large amounts which gives us a feeling of joy and comfort.
02:26,That is why we get addicted to junk food and crave to eat more and more.
02:34,We seek comfort by overeating junk food.
02:38,"This is common during periods of stress,"
02:42,"depression,loneliness"
02:44,and anxiety.
02:47,Another reason that attracts us to junk food are its advertisements.
02:53,These advertisements are often attractive
02:56,and misleading.
02:59,Children and adolescents get easily influenced by them.
03:05,Friends also affect our food choices.
03:08,"For example, a student carries chapati and vegetables to school."
03:14,"If her friends bring junk food, then she will also want to bring those items."
03:22,This shows that our eating habits get affected by what people around us eat.
03:29,"Moving ahead, let us look at some ways to avoid junk food."
03:35,Parents should understand that children learn and follow what they see.
03:41,"If they see parents eating healthy, they will also be motivated to eat right."
03:48,"Therefore, parents should be a good role model for them."
03:53,Please remember to never use junk food as a reward.
03:58,Parents often give junk food as rewards to children in some situations.
04:05,For example: to complete their school work or to score well in exams.
04:12,This gives the children a message that it is okay to eat these food.
04:18,"As they grow older, this can develop into a habit."
04:23,"Hence, never offer junk food as a reward to children."
04:29,Care should be taken to avoid eating food while watching T.V or using phones.
04:37,Eating while watching T.V distracts our mind.
04:41,"Therefore, we don’t feel satisfied and tend to overeat."
04:46,Another thing which the mothers should consider is to bring variety in meals.
04:53,The child’s regular meal can be made exciting.
04:58,Make it more colorful and nutrient-dense.
05:02,Use a combination of ingredients from different food groups.
05:08,Let me give you an example.
05:11,"Plain rice can be modified by adding lentils, vegetables or eggs."
05:19,"This way, the child will look forward to having homemade meals."
05:26,"Before planning meals, consider the child's likes and dislikes."
05:31,"If they do not like a specific ingredient, disguise it in other dishes."
05:39,"For example, some children are fussy about eating vegetables."
05:45,"You can disguise vegetables in the form of vegetable paratha, cheela or cutlets."
05:54,Vegetables can be chopped or pureed and served in the form of soup.
06:00,Try to replace junk food with healthy food.
06:04,"For example: vada, samosa or a pack of biscuits costs 5-10 Rs."
06:13,"For the same amount of money, you can buy two eggs or a glass of milk."
06:19,Do not add taste enhancing powders available in the market in children's milk.
06:26,"Instead, you can add turmeric powder or nuts and seeds powder."
06:33,You can also have chutney made of nuts and seeds instead of ketchup and sauces.
06:41,Roasted peanuts or bengal gram can be eaten instead of chips and fried chivda.
06:50,"You can also have boiled green gram, bengal gram, corn, etc."
06:58,Avoid fried puris made of refined flour.
07:02,"Instead, have chapatis or parathas made of whole grains, sorghum or pearl millet."
07:11,Replace bad fats like refined vegetable oils with good fats.
07:19,"Examples of good fat are coconut oil, pure ghee and butter."
07:26,"Nuts, seeds, eggs and fish also have good fats in them."
07:32,Avoid drinking cold drinks and juices.
07:36,"Instead, you can drink water, lime water, coconut water, buttermilk or milk."
07:44,Encourage children to eat whole seasonal fruits instead of fruit juices.
07:51,Fruit juices and sugary drinks should not be given to children below 2 years.
07:58,"In a day, the consumption of tea and coffee should be restricted."
08:04,Half a cup or 100 ml can be given to 5-9 year old children.
08:12,"For adolescents, one cup or 200 ml can be given."
08:18,"Whereas, tea and coffee should be avoided by children up to 5 years."
08:26,Children and adolescents should completely avoid energy and carbonated drinks.
08:33,The intake of junk food should be restricted to 1 serving per week.
08:40,A homemade meal with the right ingredients is healthier than outside junk food.
08:47,Always remember that it takes time to develop habits.
08:52,"Therefore, children must be taught to choose healthy food from a young age."
08:59,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thank you for joining."
