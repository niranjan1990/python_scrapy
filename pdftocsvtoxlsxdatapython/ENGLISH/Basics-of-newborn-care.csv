00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Basics of newborn care.
00:05,"In this tutorial, we will learn- How to handle a newborn,"
00:10,"Umbilical cord care,Feeding and burping a newborn,"
00:15,Diapering and diaper rash and
00:20,Sleeping pattern of a newborn.
00:23,"The entire family gets excited upon the birth of a newborn and everyone wants to see thebaby and hold the baby."
00:34,Therefore it is necessary to set some key rules while handling a newborn baby.
00:40,Newborns don’t have a strong immune system. This makes them prone to infections.
00:47,"To protect the baby from infections it is important to have clean hands before touching orholding the baby."
00:57,"To clean the hands, wash with soap and water and dry well using a clean dry cloth beforeholding the newborn."
01:06,Now comes the first thing to learn which is how to hold a baby.
01:11,"Hold the baby by supporting her head and neck with one hand and bottom with the otherhand."
01:19,"To lay a baby down, always support the baby’s head and neck and hold her bottom as well."
01:26,"On the other hand, to wake a sleeping baby up, do the following -"
01:31,"Tickle the baby's feet or lift and support the baby in a sitting position or gently touch thebaby’s ear."
01:42,Always remember that a newborn baby is sensitive.
01:47,"Some precautions to be taken while handling a newborn are -The newborn is not ready for rough play."
01:55,"Therefore, do not jiggle the baby on the knee or throw her in the air."
02:00,"Never shake the newborn, whether in play or in frustration."
02:05,"Avoid sudden jerky movements of the baby’s neck.All these may cause internal injuries to the baby."
02:14,We will now learn about Umbilical cord care at home.
02:18,"When the baby is in the mother’s womb, the umbilical cord is the baby's lifeline.However, it is no longer needed once the baby is born."
02:29,"Within a few minutes after birth as soon as the cord stops pulsating, it is clamped."
02:37,By the time the baby goes home from the hospital the cord begins to dry and shrivel.
02:44,The cord falls off by itself in about one to two weeks.
02:50,Please note that the umbilical cord may be a place for infection to enter the baby's body.
02:57,"Hence, it is essential to take care of it properly."
03:02,"For that, please remember baby’s cord should be kept dry and exposed to air."
03:09,Only sponge baths should be given until the cord falls off.
03:14,"The cord should be kept on the outside of the baby's nappy or can also be folded down tothe top edge of the nappy."
03:24,"Please consult the baby’s doctor if there is - Bleeding from the end of the cord or the areanear the skin,"
03:32,"Pus,Swelling or redness around the navel,"
03:36,Signs that the navel area is painful to the baby
03:41,and if the cord has not fallen off by one month of age.
03:46,"Sometimes it might also happen that there may be a small amount of blood when the stumpis about to fall offand also after the cord falls off. But this should be stopped quickly."
04:01,"Remember, never pull the cord off."
04:04,"Also, do not apply any cream or powder or"
04:08,tie any bandage on the baby’s umbilicus after the cord has fallen.
04:13,For the nutritional aspects of the newborn care we will discuss how to feed the baby.
04:20,The newborn should be breastfed within 1 hour after delivery.
04:25,Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months.
04:30,"Additionally, the mother should provide adequate skin to skin contact to the baby andobserve the hunger cues of the baby."
04:40,All these points have been discussed in other tutorials of the same series.
04:46,"In some cases, newborns may need to be awakened frequently so that they are fed enough,especially the smaller, premature babies."
04:57,"Incase a baby, healthy or premature, does not seem to be interested in sucking thenthe mother should consult the doctor or health worker."
05:09,"While breastfeeding, babies often swallow air which can make them fussy."
05:15,"To prevent this, make the baby sit and burp after every feed."
05:20,It has been explained in another tutorial of the same series.
05:25,"Next is diapering. After each bowel movement or if the cloth nappy is wet- lay the baby onher back and remove the dirty nappy."
05:37,Use water and soft washcloth to gently clean and wipe the baby's genital area.
05:44,"Do not apply soap on baby’s genital area.Whenever wiping a girl, wipe her from front to back to avoid a urinary tract infection."
05:55,"The mother or caregiver should always thoroughly wash hands before and after changingthe nappy."
06:02,Sometimes it could happen that a baby may suffer from diaper rash.
06:08,"Diaper rash is a common concern.Typically the rash is red and bumpy and will go away in a few days with warm baths,"
06:18,some diaper cream and at times without any diaper or nappy on the genital area.
06:25,"Most rashes happen because the baby's skin is sensitive and becomes irritated by the wetnappy."
06:33,"To prevent or treat diaper rash, change the baby's nappy often especially after bowelmovements."
06:41,"Gently clean the area with a soft cloth and water.Avoid using wipes as sometimes this can be irritating."
06:50,"Apply a very thick layer of diaper rash or ""barrier"" cream."
06:55,Creams with zinc oxide are preferred as they form a barrier against moisture.
07:02,Wash the baby’s nappy using dye and fragrance-free detergents.
07:08,"Let the baby stay without a diaper or a nappy for part of the day.This gives the skin a chance to air out."
07:17,"Incase, the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be getting worse, pleaseconsult the doctor."
07:27,It may be caused by a fungal infection that requires a prescription.
07:33,"In the end, let’s discuss about baby’s sleeping pattern."
07:38,"Babies sleep for around 14 to 16 hours or more, in a day."
07:43,Newborns typically sleep for a period of 2–4 hours.
07:48,Many newborns have their days and nights mixed up.
07:52,They tend to be awake and alert at night and sleepy during the day.
07:58,"One way to help them sleep more at night is to keep minimum stimulation at night.Example: keep the lights low by using a night lamp and during the day time try to keep herawake a little longer by talking and playing with her."
08:16,"The mother or caregiver should remember that a baby should always be on her back whilesleeping."
08:24,This reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
08:30,"For other safe sleeping practices, avoid using the following items in their crib -Blankets, Quilts, Sheep skins, stuffed toys and pillows."
08:44,All these can suffocate the baby.
08:47,"Also, be sure to alternate the position of the baby's head each night - first right, then left andso on."
08:57,This will prevent the development of flat spot on one side of the baby’s head.
09:04,This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
