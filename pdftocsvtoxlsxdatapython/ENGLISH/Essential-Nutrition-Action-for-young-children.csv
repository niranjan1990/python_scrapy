00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on essential nutrition actions for children.
00:07,In this tutorial we will learn about the best ways to prevent malnutrition.
00:15,Essential nutrition actions are preventive approach to tackle malnutrition.
00:21,"They are required during the first 1,000 days."
00:26,"First 1,000 days start from conception to the second birthday of the baby."
00:34,Essential nutrition actions are also known as ENA.
00:39,"For a newborn, the first ENA to be done is delaying the clamping of the cord."
00:47,The umbilical cord should not be cut immediately after delivery.
00:53,The nurse should first feel the pulsation of the cord.
00:58,The cord should be cut when it stops pulsating.
01:02,Delayed cord clamping allows blood flow between placenta and the baby.
01:09,This may improve the iron store in the baby for first 6 months.
01:16,Doing so prevents anemia in babies during these months.
01:21,"After clamping the cord, the baby should be breastfed."
01:26,"To do so, the baby should be placed on the mother's bare abdomen."
01:32,A baby is born with an instinctive feeding behavior.
01:38,With this behavior it can find the mother's breast
01:41,and initiate breastfeeding.
01:45,This entire process is called breast crawl.
01:50,More about breast crawl has been explained in an another tutorial.
01:55,Please visit our website for this tutorial.
01:59,It is important to start breastfeeding within one hour of birth.
02:06,The first milk is called colostrum.
02:09,It is the primary source of nutrients for a newborn.
02:14,Colostrum has infection-fighting elements and good fats.
02:20,Breast milk is also the first source of vitamin A for the baby.
02:26,Vitamin A is vital for healthy eyes and immunity.
02:33,Breastmilk is enough to meet the vitamin A requirements for the first 6 months.
02:40,"After 6 months, vitamin A rich complementary food should be given."
02:47,"For effective breastfeeding, correct latching is most important."
02:52,Poor attachment of the baby’s mouth to the breast will result in nipple feeding.
03:00,This will give very little milk to the baby.
03:04,Baby's mouth should attach to the lower part of the areola.
03:09,This way the baby will get sufficient milk.
03:13,Areola is the dark area around the nipple.
03:18,Breastfeeding techniques are discussed in other tutorials.
03:22,"On completion of 6 months, the baby's nutrient requirement increases rapidly."
03:29,At this stage exclusive breastfeeding is not enough.
03:34,"Thus, complementary food should be introduced, along with breastfeeding."
03:40,It should start as soon as the baby completes 6 months of age.
03:46,6 months of age does not mean the start of the 6th month of a baby’s life.
03:53,It means she has completed 6 months and has started the 7th month of her life.
04:02,"Also, the quantity and consistency of the food should be changed as per the age."
04:10,A baby’s diet must include different food groups.
04:15,The first food group is breastfeeding.
04:19,"Grains, roots, and tubers are the second group."
04:24,"Legumes, seeds, and nuts are the third group."
04:30,Fourth group is milk products.
04:34,"Meat, fish, and chicken are the fifth group."
04:38,Egg is the sixth group.
04:41,Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables are the seventh group.
04:47,"Lastly, eighth group is other fruits and vegetables."
04:53,"Ideally, a baby’s diet must include all 8 food groups."
04:59,All these foods provide nutrients that help in the growth of the baby.
05:05,The details of complementary feeding have been discussed in another tutorial.
05:11,Let us now look at the supplements that should be given to the babies.
05:16,"From 6 months to 5 years, iron-folic acid supplements should be given."
05:23,It has to be given to babies twice a week by healthcare workers.
05:29,Vitamin A supplement should be given twice a year.
05:34,This supplement is given from 9 months to 5 years of age.
05:40,The supplements should be given under the guidance of a health care provider.
05:46,We will now see ENA to treat a baby having diarrhea.
05:52,Diarrhea is a major cause of malnutrition.
05:56,It causes water loss and imbalance of sodium and potassium in the body.
06:03,"In severe cases, infant deaths may also happen."
06:08,"Hence, it is very important to treat diarrhea."
06:13,ORS and zinc supplements help in treating diarrhea.
06:18,ORS is Oral rehydration salts.
06:22,It replenishes the water and Sodium and potassium in the body.
06:29,It is easily available in the market as powder form in packets.
06:35,"To use it, mix one packet of ORS in 1 litre of boiled and cooled water."
06:43,"Along with ORS, Zinc supplement is necessary too."
06:48,"Zinc reduces the duration,"
06:51,"frequency, and"
06:53,severity of diarrhea in children.
06:57,It improves the immunity of the baby.
07:00,It should be given once a day for 14 days.
07:06,10 milligrams of zinc per day should be given to the babies below 6 months.
07:13,20 milligrams of zinc per day should be given to 6 months old and above.
07:21,"In a small spoon, dissolve Zinc tablets in breast milk or ORS."
07:27,You may also use boiled and cooled water.
07:31,ORS and zinc tablets should be given after consulting a healthcare provider.
07:38,"Along with ORS and zinc, less than 6 month old babies should be breastfed."
07:45,6 to 24 month old babies should be breastfed and given complementary food.
07:53,Remember a baby during sickness should be breastfed often.
07:59,It helps in faster recovery and weight gain.
08:04,It also comforts the sick baby.
08:07,"With breastfeeding, kangaroo mother care should be provided to every baby."
08:14,Kangaroo mother care is also recommended for low birth weight babies.
08:20,More about kangaroo mother care has been discussed in another tutorial.
08:26,"If the baby is older than 6 months, increase the food to one and a half times."
08:34,Do this when the baby’s appetite comes back during the recovery period.
08:40,Encourage the baby to eat by offering a variety of foods.
08:46,Give her type 1 and type 2 nutrient-rich food as per her hunger cues.
08:53,More about type 1 and type 2 nutrients has been discussed in another tutorial.
09:01,"In severe conditions, the mother should consult a health worker immediately."
09:07,Health workers should refer the severely malnourished babies to the NRC.
09:14,NRC is a nutrition rehabilitation center.
09:20,It is a unit for restoring the health of severely malnourished children.
09:27,This center provides specialized nutrition therapy to babies.
09:33,It makes them ready for home-cooked food if they have completed 6 months of age.
09:40,"It also educates mothers about breastfeeding,"
09:44,child nutrition and
09:46,child care.
09:48,Follow the Essential Nutrition actions to keep the baby healthy.
09:54,They also help in preventing malnutrition in babies.
09:59,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
