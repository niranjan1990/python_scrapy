00:01,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Football hold for breastfeeding.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about: choosing the correct breastfeeding hold for a motherand her baby,"
00:14,mother’s preparation before breastfeeding and step-by-step procedure for Football hold.
00:22,Let us begin.
00:24,"Across the world, mothers breastfeed their babies using various types of holds."
00:31,"As explained in an earlier tutorial, the best breastfeeding hold for a mother and her baby isthe one in which-"
00:41,"both mother and baby are comfortable for the entire duration of breastfeeding,"
00:48,the baby is able to attach deeply to the mother’s breast and get sufficient milk.
00:56,Let us learn about one of the holds called Football hold.
01:01,"Football hold is especially useful if the mother: has had a C-section delivery,"
01:08,"has large breasts,"
01:10,has a small or premature baby or
01:13,has twin babies.
01:15,"Always remember: before feeding her baby, a mother should wash and dry her handsproperly."
01:22,Then she should drink a glass of boiled and cooled water.
01:26,Lactating mothers produce 750 to 850 millilitres of milk per day on an average.
01:34,"Therefore, they need to increase their daily water intake."
01:38,"Next, let’s discuss the position of the mother."
01:42,Mother should sit on the floor or on the bed in cross legged position.
01:47,"Or, on a chair with her feet flat on the ground."
01:51,"If the chair is too high and her feet do not reach the floor then she can rest her feet flat on asmall stool or pillows kept on the floor."
02:02,"While sitting, she should ensure that - her back is straight so as to avoid back pain,"
02:08,her shoulders are relaxed and not elevated or curved.
02:13,"And, this relaxed position is maintained throughout the feeding session."
02:19,"The mother should keep 3 to 4 pillows on the side of the breast which she will breastfeedfrom."
02:25,"The topmost pillow should be placed diagonally over the other pillows and the mother’sthigh."
02:32,"Then, Mother should uncover the breast from which she wants to feed the baby."
02:38,She should ensure not to put pressure of her bra or blouse on the breast.
02:44,"After sitting comfortably, bring the baby to the mother."
02:49,The mother should place her baby’s back on the pillows.
02:52,"She should hold her baby's head, using the hand on the same side of the breast that she willbreastfeed from."
03:00,The baby’s legs should pass through the mother’s armpit of the same hand onto the pillow.
03:07,The mother should rest this hand and her baby’s legs on the pillows.
03:13,The mother in this picture will be feeding her baby from her right breast.
03:18,"Therefore, the baby’s legs pass through the mother’s right armpit."
03:23,"She is using the thumb and fingers of her right hand to hold the lower part of her baby’shead."
03:31,"Remember, the mother should never bring the breast to the baby by bending her back."
03:37,This will make her uncomfortable and cause back pain.
03:41,She should always keep her back straight and lift the baby to reach her breast.
03:48,"Next, let us see the correct position of mother’s thumb and fingers for holding the baby’shead."
03:55,"Mother’s thumb should be behind one ear, and rest of the fingers behind the other ear of thebaby."
04:03,She should not move her fingers or thumb from behind the ear to the baby’s neck.
04:08,Her wrist should rest between the baby’s shoulder blades.
04:13,"She should not apply pressure on the back of the baby’s head with her hand. This will keepthe baby comfortable while feeding."
04:23,"Next, let us learn how to position baby’s body correctly."
04:27,The baby’s face should be facing the mother.
04:30,Baby’s body should gently press against the mother’s body.
04:35,Lesser distance between their bodies will reduce the baby’s effort to reach the breast
04:41,and it will become easier for the baby to attach deeply.
04:46,The second point in positioning is the baby’s body alignment.
04:51,"When we eat food, our head, neck and body are always in the same direction."
04:57,"Similarly, baby’s head, neck and body should always be in the same direction whilebreastfeeding."
05:05,This will make swallowing milk easier for the baby.
05:10,"Now, we come to the third point in positioning the baby’s body."
05:16,The mother should support the full body of her baby.
05:21,Otherwise the baby will have to take a lot of effort to attach deeply to the breast.
05:29,"Next, let’s look at the position of the baby’s nose and chin."
05:34,Baby’s nose should always be in line with the nipple
05:39,and her chin should be forward and very close to the breast.
05:44,"This will ensure that the baby takes in more of the lower part of the areola while latching.And therefore, will use the lower jaw to drink more milk efficiently."
05:55,Please note- Areola is the dark area around the nipple.
06:00,"Now that the baby is positioned correctly, let us learn how to hold the breast."
06:07,"Using the fingers of her other hand, the mother should cup her breast from the side in a Cshape hold."
06:15,The mother in this picture will use her left hand to hold her right breast.
06:21,"To understand the correct position of thumb and fingers- imagine the nipple to be the centerof a clock on the right breast."
06:30,She should place her left thumb at 12’O clock position on this clock
06:35,while her left index finger and middle finger should be placed at 6’O clock position.
06:42,The fingers should always be in the direction of the baby’s lips.
06:47,Why? Let’s understand this using a simple example.
06:52,"When we eat a vada pav or burger, our lips open horizontally."
06:58,We hold the vada pav or burger horizontally to take a big bite.
07:03,"Here, the thumb and fingers are placed in the direction of the lips."
07:09,"If we hold the vada pav or burger vertically, we won’t be able to take a big bite."
07:16,"Similarly, observe the direction of the baby’s lips."
07:21,The lips are horizontal here.
07:24,"Therefore, the fingers and thumb should also be positioned horizontally on the breast."
07:32,This will help the baby to take a big part of the lower areola in her mouth.
07:38,"Apart from being in the direction of the baby’s lips, the mother’s thumb and fingers shouldalways be at a distance of 3 fingers from the nipple."
07:50,"Again, while eating a vada pav or burger, If we hold it too close, our fingers will block ourmouth from taking a big bite."
08:00,"If we hold it too far away, it will not be shaped correctly to fit in our mouth."
08:07,"Therefore, we hold it at the right distance to take a big bite."
08:12,"Similarly for the baby, the right distance is of 3 fingers from the nipple, as shown in thispicture."
08:21,"This distance will ensure that- mother’s fingers do not block the baby from taking the lowerareola in her mouth."
08:30,Mother does not compress only the nipple which will give very little milk.
08:36,Mother compresses the larger milk ducts beneath the areola to express more milk out.
08:42,"And, the breast is shaped correctly to help the baby attach deeply."
08:50,Remember- Mother’s thumb should be on the upper side of the breast
08:55,"and her 2 fingers should be on the lower side of the breast, as shown in this picture."
09:01,Let’s go back to the example of vada pav or burger.
09:05,"After holding the vada pav or burger correctly, we always compress it to take a big bite."
09:12,"Similarly, the mother should lightly compress her breast in a C shape hold from the side."
09:18,This will help the baby to take a big part of the breast in her mouth.
09:23,"But remember, mother should not compress her breast in a scissor shape hold."
09:30,Scissor shape compression will pinch the breast and cause nipple feeding.
09:36,"Also, make sure that there is equal compression of the breast with the thumb and thefingers."
09:43,"Otherwise, the nipple will shift either in the upward or downward direction and lead to poorattachment."
09:51,"Sometimes, the mother might prefer to hold her baby in a different position."
09:56,"In this picture, the baby is not facing the mother."
10:00,Baby’s head is brought towards the breast from the side of the breast and not from below.
10:07,"Baby’s lips are vertical here. Therefore, the mother should position her fingers vertically onthe breast in a U shape hold."
10:17,"Remember, For any breastfeeding position mother’s fingers and thumb- holding the breast,should always be in the direction of the baby’s lips."
10:28,"Now, the baby is in Football hold and ready to latch on for breastfeeding."
10:34,"The correct latching technique is explained in another tutorial, in the same series."
10:41,"Once the baby is latched on correctly and if the breast is not too big and heavy then themother can release the breast from her hand and keep that hand free."
10:53,This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
