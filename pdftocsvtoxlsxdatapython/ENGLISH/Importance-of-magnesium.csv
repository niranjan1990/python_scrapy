00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of magnesium.
00:05,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,"Minerals as essential nutrients,"
00:12,"Importance of magnesium in our diet,"
00:15,"Causes and symptoms of its deficiency,"
00:20,Food sources of magnesium
00:23,and Requirements for different age groups.
00:27,Let’s understand why minerals are necessary in our diet.
00:32,Minerals are essential nutrients.
00:36,We require minerals in small quantities for good health.
00:42,Our body does not produce minerals by itself.
00:46,Hence they have to be taken through diet.
00:49,Minerals are required for blood clotting.
00:53,They help in maintaining blood sugar and blood pressure.
00:57,Production of hemoglobin and red blood cells require minerals.
01:03,They contribute towards muscle contraction
01:07,and brain development.
01:10,Minerals are also needed for strong immunity
01:14,and production of thyroid hormones.
01:18,Magnesium is an essential mineral needed by our body.
01:23,It is required for muscle relaxation.
01:27,It helps in sending and receiving messages by central nervous system.
01:34,This nutrient is required for healthy bones and teeth as well.
01:40,We also need magnesium for energy production
01:44,and DNA synthesis.
01:47,Let’s try to understand the causes and symptoms of deficiency of this nutrient.
01:55,Certain factors cause increased risk of magnesium deficiency.
02:02,Among them are poor diet
02:04,and intake of processed food.
02:08,"Other factors include excessive consumption of alcohol,"
02:13,"teaand/or coffee."
02:17,Inadequate absorption of magnesium is also responsible for increased deficiency.
02:25,"During pregnancy, the requirement of Magnesium increases."
02:30,Failure to meet this requirement also leads to deficiency.
02:36,Signs of magnesium deficiency include
02:39,loss of appetite
02:41,and weakness.
02:43,"It also includes headache,"
02:46,"migraineand muscle cramps."
02:50,"If the deficiency progresses, people may experience abnormal heart beat."
02:56,Low levels of calcium and potassium are also a possibility.
03:03,Magnesium deficiency increases the risk of type 2 diabetes
03:08,and hypertension.
03:11,It may also increase the risk of osteoporosis
03:15,and heart diseases.
03:18,Osteoporosis is a condition where bone density is reduced.
03:24,The bones become fragile and prone to fractures.
03:30,"Other signs of osteoporosis are stooped posture,"
03:35,loss of height
03:38,and back pain.
03:40,"To avoid deficiency, we must include magnesium rich food in our diet."
03:47,"Beans,"
03:49,"nuts,seeds,"
03:52,leafy vegetables
03:54,and grains are good sources of magnesium.
03:59,Let’s take a quick look at this nutrient content found in these food sources.
04:06,30 grams of beans have around 64 milligrams of magnesium.
04:12,2 tablespoons of seeds have roughly 123 milligrams.
04:19,100 grams of leafy vegetables have about 194 milligrams.
04:26,20 grams of nuts have around 61 milligrams
04:31,and 30 grams of grains have nearly 81 milligrams.
04:38,"Although we can get magnesium through diet, its absorption is also important."
04:44,Phytates and oxalates present in the food hinder absorption of magnesium.
04:51,Fiber also has the same effect.
04:54,"Soaking beans before cooking,"
04:57,improves the absorption of this nutrient.
05:01,"So does fermentation,"
05.03,"germination,"
05:05,cooking
05:06,and roasting.
05:08,Recommended intake of magnesium varies for different age groups:
05:14,75 milligrams for 7 to 12 months babies
05:19,80 to 130 milligrams for 1 to 8 years old children
05:25,360 to 400 milligrams for adolescents
05:30,400 milligrams for 18 to 19 years old pregnant women
05:36,360 milligrams is recommended for 18 to 19 years old lactating mothers
05:44,"For Adults, 310 to 400 milligrams is advised"
05:50,"for Pregnant women, it is 350 milligrams"
05:55,"and, for lactating mothers, 310 milligrams is advised."
06:01,"To meet these requirements, include adequate magnesium rich food in your diet."
06:07,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining"
