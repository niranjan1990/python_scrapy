00:02,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the procedure for skin-to-skin contact after C-section.
00:11,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:14,How to perform skin-to-skin contact after C-section delivery.
00:22,Guidelines for monitoring the baby during skin-to-skin contact.
00:29,"In this tutorial, the Operating Room will be called OR."
00:36,Skin-to-skin contact will be called STS.
00:42,Let us begin.
00:44,Early STS in the operating room is essential for the mother and the newborn.
00:52,Its benefits are discussed in another tutorial in the same series.
00:59,"Its preparation, before the delivery, is also discussed in the same tutorial."
01:06,Please visit our website to watch it before going through this tutorial.
01:14,"Now, let’s discuss the procedure of skin-to-skin contact in the operating room."
01:22,"At this stage, the baby is delivered."
01:27,The umbilical cord is clamped and cut.
01:32,The surgery is still going on.
01:37,"Now, the nurse should take the baby from the doctor."
01:43,She should confirm that the baby is healthy and crying.
01:49,"Then, she should wipe the baby dry quickly."
01:55,"She should wrap the baby in a dry, sterile and warm operating room towel."
02:03,"Then, she should take the baby to the mother."
02:08,She should let the baby’s and the mother’s cheeks touch for at least 30 seconds.
02:16,"If the mother wants to kiss or hold the baby, the nurse should assist her."
02:24,The nurse must consult the doctor before assisting the mother.
02:30,She should inform the operating doctor about the readiness to start STS.
02:39,"Now, with both her hands, she should place the baby on the mother’s chest."
02:47,Baby’s head should be on the lower part of the mother's neck and upper chest.
02:54,Let the baby’s head and face touch either of the breasts of the mother.
03:02,"Then, position the baby’s chest, abdomen and legs correctly."
03:09,They should rest on the mother’s lower chest and upper abdomen.
03:16,This is the 1st or the longitudinal position for STS in the operating room.
03:26,The mother can easily hold the newborn in this position.
03:31,Baby can also be placed in a 2nd position called the horizontal position.
03:39,"In this position, there is less interference with the doctor’s operating area."
03:48,The baby's head should be placed on one breast.
03:53,Her abdomen and legs should be comfortably placed on the other breast.
04:01,The nurse should cover the baby with the towel that she was wrapped in.
04:07,Using the diaper for the baby is a choice.
04:13,It will avoid the possibility of meconium getting on the mother.
04:19,It is difficult to clean it up in the operating room.
04:25,"During skin-to-skin contact, a cap is not required to keep the baby warm."
04:33,It appears to be annoying to many babies.
04:38,It may interfere with their normal sucking reflex.
04:44,It can be put on the baby later during other hospital procedures.
04:52,"They include weighing,"
04:54,vitamin k injection
04:56,and footprint marking.
05:00,Another discomfort for the babies is the umbilical clamp.
05:06,"Traditionally, the umbilical cord is cut at least 3 to 5 cm from its base."
05:16,Then it is tied with a thread or clamped.
05:22,The hard plastic umbilical clamp is too close to the baby’s navel.
05:29,It comes in between the baby and mother’s body during STS.
05:37,The baby lifts her body to avoid pressing against it during STS.
05:45,This discomfort can be easily avoided.
05:50,The cord must be cut and clamped 8 to 10 inches long.
05:57,"This way, the clamp will not be directly between the baby and the mother."
06:04,The cord can be re-clamped and cut shorter at any time after 1st breastfeeding.
06:14,It can also be done at the time of the baby’s first bath.
06:20,Avoid routine suctioning of the baby’s mouth or nostrils during early STS.
06:29,It is often a very bad oral experience for the baby.
06:36,It can irritate the baby.
06:39,It can also interfere with her heart rate and rhythm.
06:46,Most babies are able to clear their own secretions with no trouble.
06:53,"If the baby is having difficulty clearing oral secretions, consult a doctor."
07:00,A nurse should visually observe the baby while on the mother’s chest.
07:07,This monitoring should continue until the surgery is complete.
07:13,She should constantly check the position of the baby’s head.
07:19,Baby’s nostrils must always be visible.
07:24,"Baby’s temperature, blood circulation, breathing and colour must remain stable."
07:33,Baby should not slide off the mother’s chest towards her neck.
07:39,"If this happens, the nurse should gently reposition the baby."
07:46,She should not lift the baby off the mother’s skin while repositioning.
07:54,The baby may advance to the crawling stage while in the operating room.
08:01,She may also move irregularly and search for the breast to suckle.
08:08,"In such cases, the nurse can gently grip the baby’s leg or thigh."
08:17,This will ensure that the baby stays on the mother’s chest.
08:22,It is important to continue STS after completion of the surgery.
08:30,This is discussed in detail in another tutorial of the same series.
08:37,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
