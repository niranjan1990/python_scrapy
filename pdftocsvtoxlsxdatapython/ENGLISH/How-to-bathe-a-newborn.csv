00:31,All new parents are anxious about how to bathe a newborn.
00:37,Lot of care must be taken while bathing the baby.
00:41,One wrong step can harm the newborn a lot.
00:46,"Before we begin, it is important to know the safety tips to be followed before bathing a baby-"
00:54,"The mother or the family member- should always have clipped fingernails before touchingthe baby and"
01:02,"should not wear any rings, bangles or watches."
01:07,This will reduce the chances of injury to the baby.
01:11,"So, when to give a baby its first bath?"
01:15,Mother can start giving a sponge bath to the baby after 48 hours of delivery.
01:22,Remember that only sponge bath should be given until the umbilical cord falls off.
01:28,"Once the cord falls off, the mother or any other family member can start giving regular bathto the baby."
01:37,"However, in case a baby has low birth weight then such baby should be given sponge bathsuntil it gains weight up to 2 kilograms."
01:49,Let us see how sponge bath is given.
01:53,"Before starting, ensure that the room should be warm enough with closed windows."
02:00,"Keep a very soft, clean, small cloth ready before giving a sponge bath."
02:06,"The baby should be placed on a safe, flat surface."
02:12,The floor would be the safest one.
02:15,Do not keep the baby on a high platform.
02:19,The temperature of the water for bathing should not be more than 37 degrees celsius.
02:26,Mother should check the temperature of the water using her elbow or wrist.
02:32,"During bathing, first use soapy water for cleaning."
02:37,"To make soapy water always use any mild, colourless and odourless soap or baby soap."
02:45,Then use clean water to remove the soap.
02:50,"Dip the small, soft cloth in water and squeeze out excess water."
02:56,Now wipe the baby’s eye from the inner corner to the outer edge.
03:02,Do not use the same cloth for wiping other body parts.
03:06,Always use a fresh and soft cloth to clean other body parts.
03:11,"Also, do not forget to clean creases -under arms,behind the ears,"
03:18,"around the neck,between fingers and toes and in the genital area."
03:24,"Now that we have discussed what is sponge-bath, let us learn about regular bath."
03:31,"Please remember; regular bath should be given to all healthy babies after the umbilical cordfalls off."
03:39,"During a regular bath, if you are using a bathtub - first, fill the bathtub up to 2 inches withsoapy water."
03:48,"To make soapy water, always use any mild colourless and odourless soap or baby soap asexplained earlier."
03:58,Keep another tub ready which contains fresh water.
04:03,"Then, check the temperature of the water with your elbow in both the tubs."
04:08,"After you are satisfied with the temperature of the water, very carefully place the baby inthe tub which contains soapy water, ensuring that the head is supported always."
04:22,Do not add extra water when the baby is already in the tub.
04:27,"To begin with- First, wash the baby’s head using odourless and colourless baby shampoo orsoap."
04:35,Then gently wash away the soap with fresh water.
04:39,"Next, clean the rest of the body along with the creases and nappy area which is the mostcontaminated."
04:47,"In the end, gently wash the rest of the body with fresh water."
04:53,"On the other hand - If the mother or caregiver wants to give bath to the baby in thetraditional Indian method then sit on the floor by spreading your legs parallel to each other."
05:06,"Then, place the baby on your leg."
05:09,Baby’s head should be near the mother or caregiver’s feet.
05:14,Baby’s feet should be near the mother or caregiver’s abdomen.
05:20,Now the baby is in the correct position to be bathed.
05:24,"After bathing, dry the baby immediately using soft and clean towels."
05:30,Remember to dry the creases as explained earlier.
05:34,Also avoid using talcum powder or baby powder.
05:40,Baby powders may cause breathing difficulties in newborns.
05:45,Never use surmaa or kajal in the eyes.
05:49,Use of surmaa or kajal may lead to lead poisoning and infection in newborns.
05:56,"Interestingly, special care must be taken for the babies living in hilly areas or cold regions."
06:04,"For babies in such places, a quick daily sponge bath can be given before the cord falls off."
06:11,"However, immediately after drying the baby, mother or caregiver must provide skin to skincontact to the baby."
06:20,This will reduce the risk of low body temperature in babies.
06:25,Please note that shampooing should be done twice a week.
06:30,Do not shampoo every day as it will cause dryness of the scalp.
06:35,"It might also happen that a newborn may have crusty patches or scales on the scalp.This is known as Cradle cap."
06:45,There can be some redness around these patches or the scales.
06:50,Note that there is nothing to worry about Cradle cap.
06:54,It will go away on its own and does not need to be treated.
06:59,Baby oil may help soften the scales.
07:03,"When applying the oil, rub only small amount into the scales."
07:08,Too much oil may worsen the condition.
07:12,"Then, wash the baby's hair with a mild tear-free baby shampoo within an hour or two."
07:20,"After that, gently brush out the scales an hour later to avoid more build-up."
07:27,Never pull the scales as it leads to the sore scalp and further infection.
07:33,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
