00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial about the importance of breastfeeding.
00:06,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:09,Importance of breastfeeding.
00:12,Benefits of breastfeeding for the babies and the mothers.
00:17,Breastfeeding is a vital process.
00:19,It starts from the birth of a child to its second birthday or beyond.
00:26,Breastfeeding gives a healthy start of life to the infant.
00:31,It decides the immediate and future health of a child and the mother.
00:38,The benefits of it lasts a lifetime for both of them.
00:43,Even malnourished mothers can breastfeed their baby.
00:49,"During pregnancy, breast size increases."
00:53,This is due to an increase in the number of milk producing tissues.
00:59,"However, the final size of the breasts do not affect the milk production amount."
01:07,Breastfeeding should be initiated within 1 hour of birth.
01:13,This increases the supply of breast milk.
01:17,"Therefore, exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months also increases."
01:24,It further helps in extending breastfeeding beyond 2 years.
01:31,The risk of neonatal deaths is low in babies who are breastfed within 1 hour.
01:39,Delayed breastfeeding can increase the risk of diseases in newborn babies.
01:47,"For example, diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure."
01:53,Early initiation of breastfeeding also ensures that the baby receives colostrum.
02:00,Colostrum is the first milk secreted by the mother after giving birth.
02:07,"For babies, it is a primary source of energy and nutrients."
02:13,It is important for them especially in the initial days of their lives.
02:20,"It has a large number of infection-fighting elements,"
02:24,Vitamin A and
02:26,good fat.
02:28,Numerous growth and protective factors are also there in colostrum.
02:35,Colostrum has the property which helps to remove the old feces faster.
02:42,Detailed benefits of colostrum are discussed in another tutorial.
02:48,Please check the website for more details.
02:52,Remember that exclusive breastfeeding should be done for the first 6 months.
02:59,Breast milk is a unique natural food which cannot be duplicated.
03:05,"When the baby completes 6 months, complementary food should be started."
03:12,It should be given along with breastfeeding.
03:16,Breastfeeding should be continued until 2 years or beyond.
03:22,There are many benefits of breastfeeding for the babies.
03:27,Nutrients and composition of breast milk are ideal for digestion by babies.
03:34,Through breast milk babies get antibodies.
03:38,Antibodies strengthen the immunity of the baby and reduces the risk of infections.
03:46,"Additionally, it prevents allergic reactions in babies."
03:52,Breast milk also contains growth factors.
03:56,They help in the development of the lining of the baby’s intestine.
04:02,It promotes the growth of good bacteria in the baby's intestine.
04:08,"Thus, it protects the babies against intestinal inflammation and infection."
04:16,"Similarly, it helps in the development of all other organs of the body."
04:22,Breastfeeding reduces the risk of diarrhea.
04:27,Other benefits are prevention of ear infections
04:31,and tooth decay.
04:33,Development of jaws and proper alignment of teeth are some other examples.
04:41,Risk of developing some diseases later in life also gets reduced.
04:48,"For example, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and blood cancer."
04:56,The risk of respiratory diseases like asthma and pneumonia also gets reduced.
05:04,Breastfeeding reduces the chances of sudden death in babies below 1 year of age.
05:14,The risk of developing atopic eczema is also less in breastfed babies.
05:22,"Eczema is a condition in which skin develops red, itchy and rough patches."
05:30,Breastfed babies are also less likely to be hospitalised for illness and infections.
05:39,Breastfed babies have better control over their appetite.
05:44,Breast milk contains appetite controlling hormones.
05:48,Such hormones help the babies listen to their body’s hunger and satiety signals.
05:57,This self regulation is disturbed in babies who are not breastfed.
06:03,"Eventually this can lead to overeating,"
06:07,"obesityand later diabetes."
06:11,Breastfeeding also has an effect on the brain.
06:15,The breast milk has components which help in brain development and maturation.
06:23,Breastfed children have a higher IQ and other skills.
06:28,Breast milk benefits premature babies even more.
06:34,Suckling at the breast improves the breathing in such babies.
06:40,These babies are at a risk of developing intestinal infection.
06:47,For example: Diarrhea and Necrotizing enterocolitis which is known as NEC.
06:56,NEC is a serious condition caused due to infection and damage to the intestine.
07:05,Breast milk protects premature babies from this infection.
07:11,Milk from mothers of premature babies is rich in infection fighting proteins.
07:19,It also contains intestinal protective growth promoting factors.
07:25,High concentration of specific amino acids and good bacteria is also present.
07:33,These amino acids are essential for growth in premature infants.
07:40,"Thus, breast milk helps in preventing infections"
07:43,and gaining weight.
07:46,Breastfeeding reduces long term problems caused due to premature birth.
07:52,"For example, problems of the lungs and eyes."
07:57,"Thus, premature babies should get a maximum amount of breast milk."
08:04,"Even Kangaroo mother care also known as KMC, is useful for premature babies."
08:12,It improves the frequency and duration of breastfeeding in them.
08:18,Skin to skin contact during KMC helps maintain the baby’s body temperature.
08:27,It also helps in stabilising the baby’s heartbeat and oxygen levels in blood.
08:35,The procedure for kangaroo mother care has been explained in an another tutorial.
08:42,"Apart from babies, breastfeeding is beneficial for mothers as well."
08:48,The benefits are immediate and long term.
08:53,Immediate breastfeeding after childbirth helps reduce vaginal bleeding.
08:59,It increases the level of oxytocin hormone in the body.
09:05,This helps in expelling the placenta out of the body.
09:09,As a result uterus contractions are improved and vaginal bleeding reduces.
09:17,"Thus, anaemia can be prevented in mothers."
09:21,There are psychological advantages of breastfeeding for mothers.
09:27,Frequent skin to skin contact develops bonding between the mother and her baby.
09:35,This bonding makes the mother ready to breastfeed.
09:39,"Ultimately, it reduces the postpartum stress and depression in mothers."
09:46,Breastfeeding also has long term benefits for mothers.
09:51,It prevents weakening of the bones in the later age.
09:56,The risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer also gets reduced.
10:02,"During pregnancy, women gain fat around internal body organs."
10:08,"Such as stomach, intestine and liver."
10:12,This fat is hidden in the belly or abdominal region.
10:18,"Excess of this fat can result in insulin resistance,"
10:23,"diabetes andobesity."
10:26,Breastfeeding helps reduce this fat in women.
10:31,"It minimizes the risk of obesity, hypertension and heart diseases."
10:37,Exclusive breastfeeding can act as a natural birth control.
10:44,"However, couples should use contraception after 6 weeks of delivery."
10:50,This helps in keeping space between two pregnancies.
10:56,There are some economical benefits of breastfeeding.
11:00,Breast milk is available free of cost and is best for the baby.
11:07,"It does not involve money spent on formula milk, bottles and plastic nipples."
11:14,Extra time is also not spent in preparing breast milk.
11:20,"Hot water, utensils and heating fuel is not required for preparing breast milk."
11:28,Dirty water or dirty feeding bottles can make the baby sick.
11:35,"Thus, healthcare costs for the mother and baby is low in the future years."
11:42,There are several environmental benefits of breastfeeding too.
11:47,"Firstly, breastfeeding does not involve any packaging or transportation."
11:54,"It does not produce any waste,"
11:57,smoke or
"",noise.
12:00,It reduces pollution by saving global resources and energy.
12:06,"Therefore, breastfeeding is the best option."
12:10,Mothers should ensure to breastfeed the baby from birth until 2 years of age.
12:18,This is for the good health of the baby and the mother as well.
12:24,Breastfeeding requires an understanding of the correct breastfeeding technique.
12:30,"Along with that, adequate support and guidance from the family is necessary too."
12:38,All of this has been explained in an another tutorial of the same series.
12:44,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thanks for joining."
