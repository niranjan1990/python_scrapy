Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on vegetarian recipes for 8 to 11 month old babies.
00:08,"In this tutorial, we will learn to prepare some nutritious vegetarian recipes."
00:16,"During 8 to 11 months, the baby requires upto 670 calories of energy in a day."
00:24,This energy is provided by complementary food.
00:28,Complementary food should be started after the baby completes 6 months of age.
00:35,"Along with complementary food, babies should be breastfed until 2 years of age."
00:42,"Once the baby completes 8 months, start giving her a half-cup of food."
00:49,A half-cup is about 125 millilitres
00:53,or 8 tablespoons of food.
00:56,Feed her half-cup of food four times a day.
01:01,"At this age, we can start giving finger foods to babies."
01:06,Finger foods are foods that babies can eat by themselves using their hands.
01:12,"Softly cooked, chopped vegetables and fruits are some examples."
01:18,"Pancake pieces, lentil cake, idli and vegetable cutlets are other examples."
01:26,Do not add salt in any of the baby’s food until they turn one.
01:32,Sugar and jaggery should not be added until the baby turns two.
01:37,Mother or the caregiver should ensure that the finger foods should not be hard.
01:43,"For example, do not give carrots as finger food."
01:48,Hard finger food can choke the baby.
01:52,We will now start with preparing the vegetarian recipes.
