00:00,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Feeding expressed breastmilk to babies.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn:how to make stored breastmilk ready for a baby to drink"
00:13,and how to feed expressed breastmilk to a baby.
00:18,"Let us begin.Expressing breastmilk has many benefits for the baby and the mother."
00:26,Expressing breastmilk and storing it safely are explained in other tutorials.
00:34,"Now, let us learn how to make the stored breastmilk ready for the baby to drink."
00:42,"Before handling breastmilk, the caregiver-must wash their hands with soap and water and dry their hands well."
00:52,"Remember, the oldest stored breastmilk should always be used first."
00:59,"When using frozen breastmilk, ideally defrost it by keeping it overnight on the lowest shelfof the fridge."
01:08,"And, use this defrosted milk within the next 24 hours."
01:15,"But if the frozen breastmilk is needed quickly, defrost it outside the fridge by -first keeping it in a container of cold water,"
01:25,and then keeping it in a container of lukewarm water.
01:30,"While defrosting in lukewarm water - shake the breastmilk container gently andoccasionally."
01:38,Do not shake it vigorously and continuously.
01:42,Dry the outside of the breastmilk container with a clean cloth before use.
01:47,Use this defrosted breast milk within 2 hours and throw away any unused milk.
01:56,Defrosted breastmilk can smell and taste different than fresh breastmilk.
02:03,It is fine as long as the baby accepts it.
02:08,The caregiver must always smell the breastmilk before feeding it to the baby.
02:15,"If the milk smells sour, do not use it."
02:20,"Please remember- when breastmilk is stored, it will separate with the cream rising to thetop."
02:27,This is normal. Shake gently to mix the cream back in the milk before use.
02:36,"To warm the breastmilk just before feeding it to the baby-keep the breastmilk container in a bowl of lukewarm water for 20 to 30 minutes."
02:47,Test how warm the milk is by dropping a little onto the wrist.
"",It is right when it feels warm.
02:56,"Do not use hot water to warm the breastmilk. Try to use stored breast milk straight from thefridge."
03:05,This will help to avoid the risks of over-heating and burns.
03:11,Do not heat breastmilk by keeping it directly on a stove or in a microwave.
03:18,Direct heat destroys many of the infection-fighting factors present in the breastmilk.
03:27,"When the breastmilk is ready, offer it to the baby."
03:32,"To do so, the following utensils can be used:a Paladai , a small cup, a spoon or a nifty cup."
03:42,"Out of these, it is preferable to use a spoon or a cup to feed the baby."
03:49,"Firstly, the caregiver must wash the chosen utensil with soap and waterand then air dry it completely or wipe it dry with a clean unused cloth."
04:02,"Then, the caregiver must wash and dry their hands properly."
04:10,They should half-fill or two-thirds fill the chosen utensil with breastmilk.
04:15,"Then, they should hold the baby in a nearly upright position on their lap."
04:22,Their hand should support the baby’s head and neck.
04:28,"If they are using a Paladai to feed the baby- they should position the tip of the paladai insidethe corner of the baby’s mouth."
04:39,It should be held lightly between the baby’s lips.
04:44,The tip of the paladai should lightly touch the baby’s upper lip
04:50,"In this position, the milk should stay at the rim of the beak of the paladai"
04:58,"As the baby slurps milk - the caregiver should tilt the paladai slightly to keep the milk at therim."
05:07,"If the caregiver is using a small cup to feed the baby- they should hold the cup lightlybetween the baby’s lips."
05:16,The rim of the cup should lightly touch the baby’s upper lip.
05:21,They should tilt the cup slightly until the milk reaches the top edge of the cup.
05:28,This should let the baby take the milk from the rim of the cup.
05:32,"If the caregiver is using a spoon to feed the baby- They should hold the spoon between thebaby’s lips."
05:42,The edge of the spoon should lightly touch the baby’s upper lip.
05:47,Then they should tilt the spoon slightly until the milk is at the edge of the spoon.
05:54,Feeding with a spoon is good for the first few days after birth.
05:59,Because during these days only a small amount of milk is needed.
06:06,"If the caregiver is using a nifty cup to feed the baby -They should position the small reservoir of the nifty cup just inside the baby’s mouth."
06:18,"As the baby slurps the milk, they should tilt the cup up slightly."
"",This will add milk to the reservoir as it empties.
06:30,"When feeding expressed breastmilk to the baby, never pour milk into the baby’s mouth."
06:37,This may cause the baby to choke.
06:40,"Instead, keep the milk at the rim and leave it in that position throughout the feed."
06:47,"Always ensure that the baby is fully awake, alert and interested in feeding."
06:54,"If needed, wrap the baby to prevent her from knocking the cup out of the feeder’s hands."
07:03,Always let the baby slurp milk at her own pace.
07:08,"Look for signs which show that the baby has had enough milk,"
07:13,signs such as - Holding her hands up.
07:16,Falling asleep or Closing her mouth.
07:21,"Remember, do not apply too much pressure on the lower lip of the baby."
07:27,Always let the edge of the utensil touch the baby’s upper lip lightly.
07:34,"Do not put the cup, paladai or spoon too far inside the baby’s mouth."
07:41,Never feed a baby in a lying down position.
07:45,Do not use a feeding bottle to feed the expressed breastmilk to the baby.
07:51,"After feeding the baby, wash the cup, paladai or spoon well with soap and clean water.And, let it air dry completely."
08:04,"Some babies are reluctant to take expressed breastmilk, particularly at first from somepeople."
08:12,They may be less reluctant when someone else gives it to them.
08:17,"If expressed milk is refused by the baby, try not to worry."
08:22,"On the mother’s return from work, the baby will make up any missed feeds by breastfeedingmore often or for longer."
08:32,"Remember, Keep the breastmilk safe by:washing hands, containers and utensils,feeding milk as soon as needed or storing it safely."
08:45,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
