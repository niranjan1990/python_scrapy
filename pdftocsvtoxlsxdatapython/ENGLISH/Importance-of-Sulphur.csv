00:01,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on the importance of Sulphur.
00:06,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:09,Benefits of Sulphur.
00:12,Symptoms of its deficiency.
00:15,Sulphur rich food sources.
00:18,Sulphur is the third most abundant mineral found in our body.
00:24,Most of it is derived from sulfated amino acids.
00:30,Amino acids make up the proteins.
00:34,There are 22 amino acids.
00:38,"Out of 22, a few of them have Sulphur."
00:42,"The most important sulfated amino acids are methionine andcysteine."
00:50,Methionine cannot be synthesized in the body.
00:54,Hence it has to be taken from the diet.
00:57,"On the other hand, cysteine is synthesized in our body."
01:03,However it requires a steady supply of Sulphur.
01:08,Methionine and cysteine cannot be stored in the body.
01:13,The excess amount is excreted through urine.
01:18,Otherwise it gets stored in the form of glutathione.
01:24,Glutathione is an antioxidant produced in the liver.
01:29,It protects the cells from damage and against various diseases.
01:35,It also helps to remove toxins from the body.
01:40,Many other compounds have sulphur too.
01:44,Let us have a look at the importance of those compounds.,,
01:48,I will first tell you about keratin.,,
01:52,Keratin is found in the outer layer of the human skin.,,
01:57,"For healthy hair, nails and cell growth we need Keratin.",,
02:02,Chondroitin sulfate is another compound that has sulphur,,
02:08,It delays the breakdown of cartilage in joints.,,
02:13,Improves joint mobility.,,
02:16,Might help in relieving pain caused by osteoarthritis.,,
02:22,"Osteoarthritis is a condition where joint cartilage begins to breakdown.",,
02:29,Another sulphur containing compound is alpha lipoic acid.,,
02:35,"Energy production and enzyme function requires alpha lipoicacid.",,
02:41,It also helps in lowering blood sugar levels.,,
02:45,"Apart from proteins, some B-vitamins also contain Sulphur.",,
02:51,One of them is vitamin-B1 which is also known as Thiamine.,,
02:58,We require Thiamine for normal development and growth.,,
03:04,It is also required during reproduction and breastfeeding.,,
03:09,Biotin is another B-vitamin which has sulphur.,,
03:15,Biotin is important for healthy hair growth.,,
03:19,It plays a role in cell signaling and the regulation of genes.,,
03:25,Let us now see the several roles of sulfur in our body.,,
03:31,Sulphur helps in the process of digestion.,,
03:35,Protecting the lungs from mucus formation,,
03:38,and infections.,,
03:40,Maintaining healthy eyes.,,
03:43,Reducing the chances of development of cataract in the eyes.,,
03:49,Developing the central nervous system and,,
03:53,building a strong immunity,,
03:56,Insulin production also requires sulphur.,,
04:01,Sulphur is also required during synthesis of collagen.,,
04:07,"Collagen is a protein found in bones, muscle and skin.",,
04:14,It strengthens the skin.,,
04:16,Production of hormones like cortisol also requires sulphur.,,
04:23,Aldosterone and testosterone are other examples.,,
04:28,I will now tell you the various functions of these hormones.,,
04:33,Cortisol helps to control blood sugar levels,,
04:36,and reduces inflammation.,,
04:40,It is also called a stress hormone.,,
04:44,Aldosterone's main role is to regulate blood pressure.,,
04:49,Testosterone is a male sex hormone.,,
04:54,It helps in building bone mass and muscle density.,,
04:59,Let us look at the symptoms of sulphur deficiency.,,
05:04,"Deficiency of Sulphur causes wrinkling of skin,",,
05:08,brittle hair and nails.,,
05:11,"Joint pain, convulsions and memory loss are also seen.",,
05:17,"Apart from this, toxins accumulate in the body.",,
05:21,This can increase the risk of cancer.,,
05:25,The risk of type 2 diabetes and heart diseases also increases.,,
05:32,"Gastric issues, rashes and delayed wound healing have alsobeen observed."
05:39,We will now look at some food sources rich in Sulphur.
05:45,There is no recommended dietary allowance for sulphur.
05:50,It is recommended to consume sulphur rich food daily.
05:55,"Foods rich in methionine and cystine are good sources ofsulphur."
06:02,"Eggs, fish, and chicken are good sources of methionine."
06:08,"Nuts, milk, seeds and grains also contain methionine."
06:15,"Chicken, cheese, eggs, and legumes are good sources ofcystine."
06:21,"Next we will look at the vitamin rich food sources that havesulphur."
06:27,"Whole grains, chicken, beans and nuts are sources of thiamine."
06:34,"Whereas goat liver, egg, fish, nuts and seeds have biotin."
06:42,"Sulphur is also present in garlic, onion, cabbage, and cauliflower."
06:49,"Remember to include these foods in your daily diet for goodhealth."
06:55,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
