00:01,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Storage of expressed breastmilk.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn- how to store expressed breastmilk safely for later use."
00:14,Let us begin. Expressing breastmilk has many benefits for the baby and the mother.
00:21,Expressing breastmilk by hand is explained in another tutorial in the same series.
00:29,Expressed breastmilk must be handled and stored safely.
00:34,"Doing so, will maintain its high quality for the baby."
00:39,"Before handling breastmilk, Mother should wash her hands with soap and water and drythem properly."
00:46,"To store breastmilk, Mother should use steel or glass wide-mouth containers that can bekept covered."
00:56,"Though steel containers are recommended, we will use glass containers in some of thepictures."
01:03,This will help us to clearly see the milk inside the container.
01:09,"Next, the mother should wash the chosen containers in soap and water."
01:14,"After that, she should keep the containers in boiling water for at least 10 minutes."
01:21,"Then, she should either air dry the containers completely or wipe them dry with an unusedclean cloth."
01:31,The containers should never be dried with a used cloth such as a used kitchen cloth.
01:40,"After the clean container is dried completely, she should pour the expressed milk into thecontainers."
01:48,"Mother should store only enough milk for one feeding or about 60 to 90 milliliters of milkin each container."
01:58,"If the mother plans to freeze her breastmilk, she should leave an inch of space at the top ofthe container.Because breast milk expands as it freezes."
02:12,She should label each container with the date and time of milk expression.
02:18,Then she should store these breastmilk filled containers in the coldest possible place.
02:25,"If she has a fridge, it is best to save the milk there."
02:30,"She should store the breastmilk in the back of the lowest shelf of the fridge.This is the coldest area of a fridge."
02:40,Never store the breastmilk in the door of a fridge.
02:44,"The lower the temperature of storage, the longer the storage time."
02:49,Breast milk can be stored for up to 7 days in a fridge under clean conditions.
02:56,It must be kept cold consistently.
02:59,"Remember, the more often the fridge door is opened, the more likely the temperature willrise."
03:07,"If the fridge temperature rises during storage time due to a power cut or other reasons thenthe mother should use the breastmilk within 6 hours."
03:18,"If the breastmilk is not used within 6 hours, then she should throw it away."
03:26,"If the mother doesnâ€™t have a fridge then breast milk can be stored up to 6 hours in a safe,"
"",cold and dark place in the house.
03:39,"If the room is hot, she can store the breastmilk near an earthen pot filled with cold water orin a vessel filled with cold water."
03:50,Fresh breast milk contains infection-fighting factors.
03:57,Therefore it can stay unspoilt longer than cow's milk.
04:03,"Germs do not start growing in fresh breast milk for at least 6 hours, even in a hot climateand outside the fridge."
04:15,"Another way to store breastmilk outside the fridge is by using a cool bag or box with deep-frozen ice packs, changed every 24 hours."
04:27,The milk must be protected from the ice packs or it may freeze.
04:33,The cool bag can also be used to carry milk.
04:38,"If the breast milk is to be stored for longer than 7 days, Mother should freeze it as soon aspossible after expressing."
04:49,Milk which is frozen solid in the freezer of a fridge will be good for 2 weeks.
04:56,Milk stored in a separate freezer will be good for 3 to 6 months.
05:04,"When this previously frozen breast milk is defrosted by keeping it overnight on the lowestshelf of the fridge, it should be used within 24 hours."
05:17,"And when it is defrosted outside the fridge, it should be used within 2 hours."
05:25,"In other tutorials, we have explained how to make stored breastmilk ready for the baby todrink."
05:31,"And, how to feed expressed breast milk to the baby."
05:37,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
