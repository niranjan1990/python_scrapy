00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on folate rich vegetarian recipes.
00:06,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:09,Food sources rich in folate.
00:12,Preparation of a few vegetarian recipes.
00:16,Ways to prevent the loss of folate from food.
00:20,First we will understand what is folate and its role in our body.
00:25,Folate is one of the important B vitamins.
00:30,It is required for various functions in the body.
00:34,Let us see a few examples.
00:37,Folate is essential for cell growth and repair.
00:41,It is also required for a healthy pregnancy.
00:45,This has been explained in detail in another tutorial.
00:50,Please visit our website for more details.
00:54,"Next, let us look at food sources rich in folate."
00:59,Beans and pulses are excellent sources.
01:03,Green leafy vegetables are also rich in folate.
01:07,"For example: spinach,amaranth leaves,"
01:10,"colocasia leavesand agathi leaves."
01:14,"Some vegetables like cauliflower, drumsticks and ladies finger also have folate."

03:03,"1⁄4th cup of this dip (chutney: sauce or powder made up of spices or nuts or seeds orvegetables – Bracketed text is only for International languages) will give you about 148micrograms of folate."
03:11,The second recipe is Bengal gram idli.
03:15,Ingredients required are:
03:17,1⁄4 cup or 50 grams of bengal gram.
03:21,1⁄4 cup or 30 grams of split black gram.

09:51,1 bowl of this curry will give you about 123 micrograms of folate.
09:57,Instead of spinach you can also use colocasia leaves or amaranth leaves.
10:04,"As folate is sensitive to heat, some amount of it gets destroyed while cooking."
10:11,"So, based on the raw ingredients, folate content of these recipes is calculated."
10:19,There are many ways by which loss of folate while cooking can be reduced.
10:25,Cook on low to medium flame.
10:28,Avoid repetitive heating of food.
10:32,Soak pulses and beans overnight before cooking.
10:36,This will reduce the cooking duration.
10:40,"For absorption of folate, fermentation and roasting will help."
10:45,Folate is also sensitive to water.
10:48,"Thus, steam or saute vegetables instead of boiling."
10:53,Sprouting and cooking of whole beans will enhance its folate content.
