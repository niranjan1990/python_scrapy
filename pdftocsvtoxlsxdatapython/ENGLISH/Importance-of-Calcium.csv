Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of calcium.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,"Role of calcium and its requirement in our body,"
00:13,Symptoms of its deficiency
00:16,and Calcium rich food sources.
00:20,Calcium is the most abundant mineral in our body.
00:24,99% of the body’s calcium is found in bones and teeth.
00:31,The remaining 1% is present in our blood.
00:34,"It gets excreted from our body through stool, urine and sweat."
00:41,Calcium serves many functions in our body.
00:45,The key function is the development and maintenance of bones.
00:51,"If there is an excess of calcium in the body, it gets deposited in the bones."
00:58,"In case of deficiency, it can be taken from the bones."
01:03,Calcium is essential for the transfer of nerve signals in our body.
01:09,It helps in muscle contraction and its movement.
01:14,It also helps in stopping the blood flow after a cut.
01:18,Calcium is needed for the secretion of hormones like insulin and adrenaline.
01:27,"Other benefits are maintaining body weight, blood pressure and heart health."
01:34,Daily recommended intake for calcium varies for different age groups.
01:41,It is higher during periods of rapid growth such as childhood and adolescence.
01:49,"For Infants until 12 months, 500 milligrams of calcium per day is recommended."
01:57,"For children upto 9 years, 600 milligrams per day is recommended."
02:03,The requirements increase upto 800 milligrams per day during adolescence.
02:10,"For adults, it is 600 milligrams per day."
02:15,The calcium requirements are also high during pregnancy and lactation.
02:21,"During pregnancy and lactation, 1,200 milligrams is recommended."
02:29,Let us now discuss the effects of calcium deficiency.
02:34,Deficiency of calcium during pregnancy can result in a rise in blood pressure.
02:42,Swelling in hands and feet can be seen.
02:46,Inadequate calcium intake by mothers may affect the baby also.
02:53,Their birth weight may be low and their growth can be retarded.
02:58,Their physical and cognitive development can be damaged.
03:03,"In children, calcium deficiency can cause rickets."
03:08,Rickets is a disorder of the skeletal system.
03:12,The growth gets stunted and there are changes in the shape of the spine.
03:18,"Other signs are sunken ribs, protruding forehead and bow shaped bent legs."
03:26,"Short height, widening of the wrist, elbow, knee and ankle joints can be seen."
03:34,"In adults, early signs of calcium deficiency are muscle cramps."
03:40,Numbness or tingling sensation of fingers is also seen.
03:46,"Mental confusion,"
"","irritability,"
03:49,"dry skin,brittle nails"
03:51,and tooth decay can also occur.
03:55,Long term deficiency of calcium can result in osteoporosis.
04:01,"In osteoporosis, the bone density is reduced."
04:06,The bones become fragile and prone to fractures.
04:10,"Other symptoms are stooped posture, loss of height and back pain."
04:18,The risk of osteoporosis is higher in women as compared to men.
04:23,This is because estrogen levels in women decrease after menopause.
04:29,"Thereby, calcium absorption decreases and its excretion through urine increases."
04:37,"To avoid calcium deficiency, adequate intake of calcium rich food is essential."
04:44,The best sources are milk and milk products.
04:48,"This includes curd, paneer (unsalted Indian cheese – Bracketed text is only forInternational languages), cheese and khoa (thickened whole milk – Bracketed text isonly for International languages)."
04:55,Calcium obtained from them gets easily absorbed in our body.
05:00,200 millilitre of cow’s milk provides 236 milligrams of calcium.
05:07,100 grams of curd from cow’s milk has 150 milligrams calcium.
05:14,30 grams of paneer from cow’s milk has 142 milligrams calcium.
05:21,Few non-vegetarian food are also rich in calcium.
05:25,"For example: dried shrimp, bombay duck, prawns, lobsters and dried bony fishes."
05:34,100 grams of prawns will give 67 milligrams of calcium.
05:40,20 grams of dried shrimp has 73 milligrams of calcium.
05:46,15 grams of dried bombay duck fish has 208 milligrams of calcium.
05:54,Seeds are an excellent source of calcium.
05:58,"For example: sesame seeds, niger seeds, flax seeds, dill seeds and poppy seeds."
06:05,1 tablespoon or 5g of sesame seeds has 64 milligrams of calcium.
06:14,"Apart from these, nuts like almonds and walnuts are also rich in calcium."
06:21,Many green leafy vegetables have good amount of calcium.
06:26,"For example: leaves of amaranth, agathi, drumstick and fenugreek."
06:33,"Even radish leaves, colocasia leaves and mustard leaves are good sources."
06:39,100 grams of amaranth leaves has 330 milligrams of calcium.
06:46,100 grams of fenugreek leaves has 274 milligrams of calcium.
06:52,"Calcium is present in some beans, like soybean, horse gram and moth beans."
07:00,50 grams of horse gram gives 135 milligrams of calcium.
07:07,Finger millet is also a rich source of calcium.
07:11,30 grams of finger millet provides 110 milligrams of calcium.
07:18,"Along with food intake, calcium absorption is equally important."
07:24,"Presence of oxalates, phytates and fiber affect calcium absorption."
07:30,"They are present in nuts, seeds, beans, and green leafy vegetables."
07:38,These substances may bind with calcium to form an insoluble complex.
07:45,"As a result, calcium absorption in the body is inhibited."
07:50,The absorption can be enhanced by using various cooking techniques.
07:56,"For example: soaking, sprouting, boiling, roasting and fermentation."
08:05,"For calcium absorption, avoid tea, coffee and cola with calcium rich food."
08:13,They contain caffeine which enhances calcium excretion through urine.
08:20,"For maximum calcium absorption, few other nutrients are required."
08:25,"For example: vitamin D, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus."
08:32,"Apart from nutrients, adequate physical activity and exercise are also required."
08:39,This will enhance the bone mass and bone strength.
08:44,"In addition to all this, age also influences calcium absorption."
08:50,It is highest during infancy and childhood.
08:55,"During adulthood, absorption is moderate and then it decreases with age."
09:02,"Therefore, adequate intake of calcium rich food from an early age is essential."
09:09,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thank you for joining."
