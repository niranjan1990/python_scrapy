00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on WHO weight-for-age percentile growth charts.
00:10,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:13,Plotting on weight-for-age percentile growth charts.
00:20,Interpreting plotted points for growth indicators.
00:26,Identifying problems on growth charts.
00:31,Percentile growth charts are discussed in another tutorial of the same series.
00:39,Basics of growth charts and plotting are explained in that tutorial.
00:46,"The first type of percentile growth chart, length-for-age, is also explained."
00:54,It is important that you watch it before watching this tutorial.
01:01,Please visit our website for more details.
01:06,"Now, let’s learn more about the second type of percentile growth chart."
01:14,It is the weight-for-age growth chart.
01:19,Weight-for-age reflects body weight according to the child’s age.
01:26,"On weight-for-age charts, the y-axis shows weight in kgs."
01:34,The horizontal lines mean an increase in weight by 0.2 kgs or 200 grams.
01:45,The x-axis shows age.
01:49,It starts with zero which is at birth.
01:55,Age is plotted in completed months and years from 0 to 2 years of age.
02:04,Let’s go through the steps to plot weight-for-age in this chart.
02:12,"First, mark the exact age, that is months and years, on the x-axis."
02:20,"Then, mark the weight on the y-axis with a point."
02:26,Extend it over the connected horizontal line till the marked point for age.
02:34,Extend the marked point for age over the connected vertical line.
02:41,The point where the two extended lines intersect is called a plotted point.
02:49,"For every child, points should be plotted over weekly or monthly measurements."
02:57,Always connect adjacent points with a straight line.
03:03,This will help to identify any growth problems in the child.
03:10,Let’s use an example to understand plotting points on this chart.
03:17,This graph shows Amit’s weight-for-age plotted thrice over 6 months.
03:25,Amit weighed 4.4 kgs at 1 month of age.
03:32,It is almost at the 50th percentile.
03:36,"It means he is of average weight, one month after birth."
03:43,He weighed 6.5 kgs at three months of age.
03:49,It is a little above the 50th percentile line.
03:55,It means he is of average weight at three months of age.
04:01,He weighed 8.8 kgs at six months of age.
04:08,It is at the 85th percentile line.
04:13,It means Amit is of above average weight at 6 months of age.
04:21,It means 15% of children of his age weigh more than him.
04:28,85% of children of his age weigh less than him.
04:35,"Next, let’s learn more about the average weight of a child."
04:41,It is along the 50th percentile line in the weight-for-age growth chart.
04:49,The average birth weight of a girl is 3.2 kgs.
04:56,"At 1 month, a girl’s average weight is 4.2 kgs."
05:03,"At 3 months, it is 5.8 kgs."
05:08,The average weight of a 6-month-old girl is 7.3 kgs.
05:16,"At 1 year, it is 9 kgs."
05:21,"At 2 years, it is 11.5 kgs."
05:27,The average birth weight of a boy is 3.3 kgs.
05:34,"At 1 month, a boy’s average weight is 4.4 kgs."
05:41,"At 3 months, it is 6.4 kgs."
05:47,The average weight of a 6-month-old boy is 8 kgs.
05:54,"At 1 year, it is 9.6 kgs."
06:00,"At 2 years, it is 12.2 kgs."
06:06,"Now, let’s look at the average weight gain for a boy in this table."
06:13,This column shows the average weight gain per day for a boy.
06:19,This column shows the average weight gain per week for a boy.
06:27,"In the first week, the weight gain is 28.5 grams per day."
06:35,Total weight gain in the first week is 200 grams.
06:42,"In the 5th week, the weight gain is 42.8 grams per day."
06:50,Total weight gain in the 5th week is 300 grams.
06:56,"In the 9th week, the weight gain is 28.5 grams per day."
07:04,Total weight gain in the 9th week is 200 grams.
07:10,"When interpreting growth charts, be alert for situations that suggest risk."
07:18,A sharp decline in the growth line of a child indicates a growth problem.
07:26,"Even if a child is overweight, he should not have a sharp decline in his growth."
07:34,Losing too much weight rapidly is not healthy for any child.
07:42,The overweight child should maintain his weight while increasing in length.
07:49,"On the other hand, a rapid incline in the growth line is healthy sometimes."
07:57,This chart shows Arun’s weight on the 50th percentile line till 6 months of age.
08:07,This was because of adequate and effective breastfeeding.
08:13,"Then, his weight dropped to the 15th percentile line in the 7th month."
08:21,He did not get adequate complementary food after completing 6 months.
08:29,He was also ill and had diarrhea.
08:34,"Then, in the 8th and 9th months, his weight started increasing."
08:41,"In these months, he got adequate breastmilk and"
08:46,complementary food.
08:49,"Therefore, his growth chart shows an incline."
08:55,The average birth weight of an Indian child is 2.7 kgs.
09:03,"So, an incline in their growth line is important in the first few months."
09:11,Correct breastfeeding techniques also cause a sharp incline in the charts.
09:18,This chart shows that Supriya’s birth weight was on the 50th percentile line.
09:26,"Then, in first month, her weight dropped to the 15th percentile line."
09:34,This happened because of ineffective breastfeeding.
09:40,Her mother was taught the correct breastfeeding technique for deep latching.
09:47,"Within a month, Supriya’s weight increased to the 50th percentile line."
09:55,"However, a sharp incline is risky for babies who are fed animal milk or formula."
10:05,"If they gain weight rapidly, then they can become overweight at 1 year of age."
10:13,Another growth problem for any child is a flat growth line or growth stagnation.
10:23,"A flat growth line, also called stagnation, usually indicates a problem."
10:31,"If a child’s length or weight stays the same over time, she is not growing."
10:39,Even one month’s stagnation in growth represents a possible problem.
10:46,The only exception is with an overweight child.
10:52,This child can maintain the same weight over time while the length increases.
11:00,This will bring the child to a healthier weight for his length.
11:06,Another problem is slow growth.
11:11,"Here, Pooja’s average weight gain is only 500 grams per month."
11:19,Her birth weight was average at the 50th percentile line.
11:25,"However, here we can see that she became undernourished in just 3 months."
11:34,She needs effective breastfeeding to come back to the 50th percentile line.
11:42,Please follow the growth chart to evaluate a child’s growth.
11:48,Take adequate measures if the growth falters due to any reason.
11:55,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
