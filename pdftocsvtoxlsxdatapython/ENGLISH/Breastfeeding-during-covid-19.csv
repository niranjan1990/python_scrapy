00:02,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on breastfeeding during COVID-19.
00:09,"In this tutorial, we will learn"
00:12,What is COVID-19 and
00:14,Guidelines for breastfeeding during COVID-19.
00:19,Let us first understand what is COVID-19?
00:24,COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus called coronavirus.
00:33,This virus has spread throughout the world.
00:37,"When infected people sneeze or cough, they generate droplets."
00:44,These droplets contain the corona virus.
00:49,The infection spreads when other people inhale these infected droplets.
00:56,These droplets can also travel for 1 to 2 metres and settle on surfaces.
01:04,There they remain alive for hours or days.
01:09,Other people touch such infected surfaces with their hands.
01:15,"Then, they touch their eyes,"
01:18,"noseor mouth without washing their hands."
01:23,This is another way in which the infection spreads.
01:28,Infected people can spread the virus even before the onset of symptoms.
01:35,There is no clear evidence of intrauterine transmission of this virus to date.
01:43,This virus has not yet been detected in the breastmilk of infected mothers.
01:51,There is no evidence so far that it is transmitted through breastfeeding.
01:57,The clinical symptoms of the coronavirus infection are various.
02:03,"Fever,cough,"
02:05,"breathlessness,fatigue,"
02:07,"headache,sore throat are common."
02:12,"Vomiting,diarrhoea,"
02:14,"sneezingand conjunctivitis are uncommon."
02:19,Infected people can also show no symptoms.
02:25,Newborns and infants are at low risk of COVID-19.
02:30,There are only a few cases of confirmed COVID-19 in young children.
02:37,Most of the infected babies have experienced only mild or no symptoms.
02:44,"Now, let’s discuss the guidelines for breastfeeding during COVID-19."
02:51,Breast milk is essential for all babies.
02:56,This includes babies born to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
03:03,This also includes babies with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
03:10,All babies should be fed according to the standard infant feeding guidelines.
03:17,Breastfeeding should be initiated within 1 hour of birth.
03:22,Exclusive breastfeeding should continue for 6 months.
03:28,"If needed, the mother’s expressed breast milk can be given."
03:34,Complementary feeding must be started at 6 months of age.
03:40,Breast milk must be fed at least up to 2 years of age.
03:46,"Breastfeeding, expressing milk and complementary feeding are essential skills."
03:54,They are discussed in other tutorials.
03:59,Please watch the prerequisite health and nutrition series on our website.
04:06,"During COVID-19, special care must be taken to feed the baby hygienically."
04:13,"Mother should wash her hands for 20 seconds, before and after touching the baby."
04:21,She should also wash hands before and after breastfeeding or expressing milk.
04:28,An alcohol-based hand rub can also be used to clean hands.
04:34,"If she is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19, medical masks are needed."
04:43,She should wear a mask during breastfeeding
04:46,and expressing milk.
04:49,The mask must be replaced as soon as it becomes damp.
04:55,The used mask should be disposed of immediately.
05:01,It should not be re-used.
05:04,Mother should not touch the front surface of the mask.
05:09,She should remove it from behind.
05:13,"Sometimes, medical masks may not be available."
05:19,"In such cases, mother should use a tissue"
05:22,"or a clean clothor a handkerchief."
05:27,She should always sneeze or cough into it.
05:31,She must immediately throw it in the dustbin and wash her hands.
05:38,"A soiled tissueor cloth"
05:40,or handkerchief should be changed as often as needed.
05:46,Cloth masks can also be used if medical masks are not available.
05:53,The mother need not wash her breast before every feeding.
05:58,She should wash them if she has been coughing on her chest.
06:04,She should use soap and warm water to wash them gently for at least 20 seconds.
06:12,Baby’s caretakers must wash their hands before and after touching the baby.
06:19,All the surfaces in the room must be routinely cleaned and disinfected.
06:26,Some infected mothers may be too unwell to breastfeed.
06:32,"In such cases, the baby should be fed expressed breast milk of the mother."
06:39,A nurse or family member can feed this milk to the baby.
06:45,The feeder should not have been in contact with infected people.
06:51,"Before touching the baby or the milk, they must wash their hands for 20 seconds."
06:59,"After washing their hands, they must also wear a mask."
07:05,Expressed milk can be fed to the baby without pasteurization.
07:11,The collection and transport of expressed milk should be done very carefully.
07:18,Breastfeeding should be started again when the mother recovers.
07:24,Some infected mothers may be too unwell to express milk.
07:29,"In such cases, try other options to nourish the baby."
07:35,Check if human milk is available from a donor human milk bank.
07:41,Feed donor human milk to the baby until the mother recovers.
07:47,"If donor human milk is not available, try wet-nursing until the mother recovers."
07:56,"Wet-nursing means to let a woman, who isn’t the mother, breastfeed the baby."
08:03,"If wet-nursing is not possible, feed animal milk to the baby."
08:11,Always boil the animal milk before feeding it to the baby.
08:16,Please ask your healthcare provider for their opinion on these options.
08:23,"Don’t use formula milk,"
08:25,feeding bottles
08:27,"and plastic, rubber or silicone nipples."
08:32,Help the mother to start breastfeeding again when she recovers.
08:38,Another important practice is skin-to-skin contact between the mother and baby.
08:46,It must start immediately after birth even if the mother has COVID-19.
08:53,This will help in initiating breastfeeding.
08:58,Kangaroo mother care should be performed throughout the day and night.
09:04,Breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact reduces the risk of death in babies.
09:12,They provide immediate and lifelong health and development advantages.
09:20,Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer for mothers.
09:27,These benefits are substantially greater than the risks of getting infected.
09:34,"Lastly, mother and family members must be counselled regarding the warning signs."
09:42,They must be trained to look for the warning signs in the baby.
09:48,"If they see any signs, they should report back to the doctor."
09:54,The guidelines in this tutorial are based on limited evidence as available now.
10:01,"As new evidence accumulates, some of the recommendations may change."
10:08,Please use these guidelines in accordance with the latest government regulations.
10:14,This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
