Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the Indian law to protect breastfeeding.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,Infant milk substitutes or IMS.
00:13,The IMS Act.
00:16,Let us first understand what are infant milk substitutes?
00:23,Infant milk substitutes are also called IMS.
00:29,IMS are baby foods presented as a partial
00:33,or total replacement for breast milk.
00:39,They include all commercial baby foods for infants upto 2 years old.
00:48,"In this tutorial, we will refer to IMS as commercial baby foods or baby foods."
00:58,Why do people use commercial baby foods?
01:03,There are 5 major reasons for the popular use of commercial baby foods.
01:11,The first reason is the myth that compares commercial baby foods to breast milk.
01:20,It is believed that they are as good as breast milk.
01:26,They can substitute breastfeeding completely.
01:31,Some uninformed people may believe them to be better than breast milk.
01:40,This myth is popular because their harms are not known or seen easily.
01:48,People are not guided about their harmful effects properly.
01:54,"Also, the marketing techniques portray them to be equivalent to breastmilk."
02:02,Even many doctors or health care workers are not aware of their harmful effects.
02:10,They do not know the losses caused by not breastfeeding.
02:17,"Hence, commercial baby foods are not considered dangerous by most people."
02:25,There is a general social acceptance of commercial baby foods.
02:32,This applies to feeding bottles and artificial nipples as well.
02:39,No commercial baby food can be equivalent to breastfeeding.
02:46,They may imitate the common constituents of breast milk.
02:52,"Common constituents include proteins, calories or fats."
02:59,"However, they cannot have the numerous constituents of breast milk."
03:06,"Also, breast milk varies for each mother and her baby."
03:13,Commercial baby foods do not have this quality.
03:18,They are the same for all mothers and babies.
03:24,They also do not have the psycho-emotional benefits of breastfeeding.
03:31,They are very well known to cause undernutrition or obesity.
03:38,They also cause infectious and noninfectious diseases.
03:44,These diseases include cardiovascular problems
03:48,and allergies.
03:51,Their worst effect is that they make breastfeeding seem unimportant for babies.
03:59,They stop people from seeing that breastfeeding is free and the best.
04:08,The 2nd reason for using baby foods is that they seem like an easy shortcut.
04:16,Breastfeeding is a skill.
04:19,It takes time and effort to learn or assist the proper breastfeeding technique.
04:28,There could be problems while learning how to breastfeed.
04:34,Mother needs the family’s support to breastfeed at home.
04:40,She also needs society's support to breastfeed outside home or at work.
04:49,"Therefore, commercial baby foods are considered as convenient alternatives."
04:57,Let’s discuss the third reason for the use of commercial baby foods now.
05:04,Not well informed health care workers use baby foods as an easy solution.
05:12,They may not know how to help mothers to breastfeed properly.
05:18,"So, in a problematic situation, they recommend commercial baby foods by default."
05:27,The 4th reason for using baby foods is their heavy promotion by manufacturers.
05:36,Scientific words and rewards are used to convince people to buy baby foods.
05:44,They are used to convince health care workers to prescribe baby foods easily.
05:52,The 5th reason for using baby foods is the emotional weakness of new mothers.
06:01,Their worries increase during their own problems.
06:06,They also increase during disasters such as floods or the COVID-19 crisis.
06:16,They lose confidence and feel that breast milk won’t be enough for their baby.
06:23,They start believing the wrong advice on the usefulness of baby foods.
06:31,Then they start using commercial baby foods.
06:37,Now let’s discuss the history of commercial baby foods promotion briefly.
06:45,"Since its invention, the promotion has made breastfeeding look unimportant."
06:53,Their companies directly target pregnant or lactating women and health workers.
07:02,They try to promote baby foods through nutrition or breastfeeding workshops.
07:09,They do free product distribution during emergencies like floods or earthquakes.
07:19,They also try to promote baby foods at grocery stores and medical stores.
07:27,Commercial baby foods are prominently displayed in the stores.
07:33,They use incentives to lure people to buy and use commercial baby foods.
07:42,Health activists realised how harmful these strategies are for babies.
07:50,Infancy is a vulnerable period of life.
07:55,Inappropriate feeding practices like improper use of baby foods are very risky.
08:05,"So, the regulation of commercial baby foods promotion requires special laws."
08:14,"Therefore, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was created."
08:23,It was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1981.
08:30,This urged all countries to make laws regulating the marketing of baby foods.
08:39,"India passed the “Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods (Regulationof Production, Supply and Distribution) Act 1992, and Amendment Act 2003”."
08:57,It is also called the IMS Act.
09:02,There are many laws passed by all the countries enacting the code.
09:09,"Among all the laws, the IMS Act is one of the most stringent laws."
09:17,The provisions of the IMS Act are very clearly put up by BPNI.
09:25,BPNI is the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India.
09:32,"Now, let’s discuss the 10 violations of the IMS Act."
09:39,The IMS Act is considered violated if:
09:44,A food is promoted by any means specifically for children up to 2 years of age.
09:53,The name of the food doesn’t matter.
09:57,If the products under the scope of the IMS Act are advertised.
10:04,"This includes infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles and infant food."
10:12,Any ad in any form or any medium violates the IMS act.
10:20,"It includes TV, newspapers, magazines, journals, radio, SMS advertisements."
10:30,"It also includes social media, billboards, banners and other advertisements."
10:39,If the product or its samples are distributed to any person directly.
10:47,This includes pregnant women or lactating women.
10:53,If any kind of incentive is offered to use or sell the product.
11:01,"Incentives could be discounts or free gifts, etc."
11:08,If educational material related to the promotion of IMS is distributed.
11:16,If the labels of these products carry specific pictures for increasing sales.
11:24,"These pictures could be of mothers, babies, cartoons, graphics, etc."
11:33,"If a hospital, nursing home, chemist shop promotes IMS in any way."
11:41,This includes displaying placards or posters of IMS companies.
11:49,If money or gifts are offered to health workers or their family to promote IMS.
11:58,If an IMS company or its distributor provides direct or indirect contributions.
12:08,"It includes funding for seminars,"
12:11,"meetings,conferences"
12:14,or educational courses.
12:17,"It also includes sponsorships,"
12:21,research grants or fellowships.
12:25,Sponsorship of health workers or their associations is also not allowed.
12:33,If the volume of sales of IMS is the basis for fixing the sales commission.
12:42,"By doing so, the IMS company or its product distributor violates the IMS Act."
12:51,Please report these violations immediately.
12:56,"To do so, you can use the BPNI STANPAN SURAKSHA mobile application."
13:05,This application is very user-friendly.
13:11,It involves only 2 simple steps to report a violation.
13:17,"When you detect any violation, open the application."
13:23,Click the tab in the menu 'Report promotion of baby foods or feeding bottles'.
13:32,The reporting page will open.
13:36,Provide necessary information in the designated columns.
13:42,Attach any photograph or document if you have.
13:48,Submit it.
13:51,"Remember, IMS companies may state the benefits of breastfeeding in their ads."
13:59,"However, any such ad still makes a mother doubt her plan to breastfeed."
14:07,Their ads are designed to sell baby foods to as many mothers as possible.
14:14,"The sooner a mother stops breastfeeding, the more formula is purchased."
14:21,This is why IMS companies try to make breastfeeding seem unimportant.
14:30,Breastfeeding is essential for a baby at least until 2 years of age.
14:38,The correct breastfeeding technique is important for breastfeeding adequately.
14:45,It is discussed in other tutorials in the same series.
14:51,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
