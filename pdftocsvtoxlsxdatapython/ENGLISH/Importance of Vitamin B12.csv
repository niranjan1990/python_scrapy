Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial about the importance of vitamin B12.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,Role of vitamin B12 in the body.
00:13,Causes and symptoms of its deficiency.
00:17,Food sources rich in vitamin B12.
00:21,Vitamin B12 is an important B vitamin and is naturally present in some foods.
00:29,It is water soluble and is also known as cobalamin.
00:35,Some amount of it can be produced by the good bacteria in our intestine.
00:41,Supplements of this vitamin are also available in the market.
00:47,Please consult your doctor before taking vitamin B12 supplements.
00:53,Vitamin B12 plays many important roles in our body.
00:58,It is required for proper red blood cell formation and for DNA synthesis.
01:06,This vitamin is particularly important for women of child bearing age.
01:13,Adequate vitamin B12 intake helps to prevent neural tube defects.
01:20,Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain or spinal cord.
01:26,"To avoid this defect, along with vitamin B12, folate and choline are also needed."
01:35,Importance of folate and choline have been discussed in another tutorial.
01:42,"To know more, please visit our website."
01:46,Neural tube defects can result in physical disabilities in the child.
01:52,Muscle weakness of the legs and
01:55,paralysis may also happen.
01:58,Curved spine and loss of urinary bladder control are other symptoms.
02:06,Difficulty in eating and swallowing is also found to be common.
02:12,Another function of vitamin B12 is brain development in children.
02:20,It helps to improve many brain related functions.
02:25,"For example: attention span,"
02:28,"memory,planning  and"
02:30,problem solving.
02:32,Vitamin B12 also converts folate into its active form.
02:39,Folate is required in its active form to carry out various roles in the body.
02:46,"For example: growth,"
02:49,repair and
02:51,production of new cells in the body.
02:54,The absorption of B12 is also important for it to carry out all these functions.
03:03,I will briefly tell you the way it is absorbed in the body.
03:08,Vitamin B12 in the food is attached to a protein.
03:14,"For the body to absorb vitamin B12, two steps are essential."
03:21,"Firstly, the acid in the stomach separates vitamin B12 from that protein."
03:28,The stomach then secretes another protein called intrinsic factor.
03:34,B12 then attaches to the intrinsic factor
03:38,and gets absorbed in the intestine.
03:42,Inadequate absorption of vitamin B12 can result in itâ€™s deficiency.
03:49,"For example, absorption is affected in people having pernicious anemia."
03:57,"In this condition, the body is unable to produce the intrinsic factor protein."
04:04,"Intrinsic factor is crucial for the absorption of vitamin B12, as explained earlier."
04:13,Inadequate absorption can be due to several other reasons also.
04:19,"For example, due to growth of bad bacteria or"
04:24,inflammation in the intestine.
04:28,Gastric bypass surgery also reduces absorption of vitamin B12.
04:35,Intestinal worms also affect the vitamin B12 levels.
04:41,These worms take up vitamin B12 from our blood
04:46,and cause its deficiency.
04:49,"Hence, regular deworming should be done after consulting a doctor."
04:54,Another reason for B12 deficiency is insufficient intake.
05:02,Older men and women above 65 years of age may have a very low intake.
05:10,Low intake is seen in vegetarians
05:13,and those who avoid milk and milk products.
05:17,Vitamin B12 deficiency may sometimes go undetected in vegetarians.
05:24,This is because their diets can be usually rich in folate.
05:30,Excessive folate may mask the early symptoms of B12 deficiency like anemia.
05:38,"As a result, nerve damage may progress."
05:42,This might get detected only when deficiency gets severe.
05:48,"Hence, adequate intake of both folate and vitamin B12 is necessary."
05:57,Recommended folate intake and its food sources is explained in another tutorial.
06:04,Let us now look at the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.
06:12,Soreness of the tongue and mouth ulcers are common symptoms.
06:17,Inflammation of the stomach can also occur.
06:21,Anemia is another common symptom of B12 deficiency.
06:27,It is a condition in which there is a lack of enough healthy red blood cells.
06:35,Red blood cells carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues.
06:41,"Pallor, fatigue and shortness of breath are indications of anemia."
06:48,"Reduced appetite,"
06:51,diarrhea
06:54,and jaundice is also seen.
06:58,Severe deficiency of B12 damages the myelin sheath.
07:04,Myelin sheath is a protective layer surrounding the nerves.
07:08,"Hence, the nervous system is affected."
07:14,"In babies this can result in Infantile tremor syndrome, also known as ITS."
07:23,It occurs in babies breastfed by vegetarian mothers who also avoid dairy.
07:31,Dairy items include milk and milk products.
07:37,One of the main characteristics of ITS is tremors.
07:42,These tremors are jerky and can be intermittent or continuous.
07:49,"Pale face, thin and scattered dry hair are other characteristics."
07:56,"Dark skin pigmentation is also seen on the knees, elbows and knuckles."
08:04,Such babies are irritable and show little interest in the surroundings.
08:11,They stare blankly without any expression.
08:15,B12 deficiency can delay mental and physical development in children.
08:23,They may have difficulty in learning and paying attention.
08:28,"In adults, there may be poor reflex action"
08:32,and impaired balance and coordination.
08:36,Tingling or prickling sensation in hands or legs can also happen.
08:42,Confusion and seizures are other symptoms.
08:47,Vision and memory also get affected due to deficiency.
08:54,"Hallucinations, lack of concentration and depression can also occur."
09:00,Vitamin B12 deficiency increases the risk of heart diseases too.
09:07,Chest pain and slurred speech may occur.
09:11,I will explain to you how this occurs.
09:17,Vitamin B12 is essential for conversion of homocysteine to methionine.
09:25,Homocysteine and methionine are types of amino acids used to make protein.
09:33,Elevated homocysteine levels can damage the heart.
09:38,"With the help of B12, homocysteine gets converted to methionine."
09:45,"In this way, homocysteine levels in the body gets lowered."
09:52,"Thus, protecting our heart from damage."
09:56,"To avoid deficiency, adequate intake of vitamin B12 is recommended for all ages."
10:06,"For babies of 6 to 12 months, 1.2 microgram per day is recommended."
10:13,1.2 microgram is also recommended for 1 to 6 year old children.
10:22,For children above 7 years and for adolescents it is 2.2 micrograms.
10:31,Adult men and women should also have 2.2 micrograms per day.
10:39,The requirements are higher for pregnant and lactating women.
10:46,2.45 micrograms per day is recommended for pregnant women.
10:53,3.2 micrograms per day is recommended for lactating mothers.
11:00,The required amount of vitamin B12 can be met through diet
11:05,and supplements.
11:08,Vitamin B12 is found in animal based foods.
11:13,"Fish, chicken, meat and eggs are good sources of vitamin B12."
11:22,One egg has about 0.6 microgram vitamin B12.
11:28,Eighty five grams of goat meat has about 2.3 micrograms of vitamin B12.
11:38,Eighty five grams of chicken has about 0.3 micrograms of vitamin B12.
11:47,"Shellfish, liver, kidney, and heart are also excellent sources."
11:54,50 grams of goat liver has about 45 micrograms of vitamin B12.
12:02,50 grams of clams has 49 micrograms.
12:08,Please note that shellfish should not be given to children below 1 year of age.
12:15,Milk and milk products also contain vitamin B12.
12:20,A 250 millilitre glass of milk has about 0.3 microgram of vitamin B12.
12:30,150 grams or a bowl of curd has nearly 0.2 microgram.
12:37,"Apart from food sources, maintaining a healthy gut is also important."
12:44,A healthy gut improves the vitamin B12 absorption in the body.
12:51,Vegetarian foods have none or minimal amounts of vitamin B12.
12:57,"However, it can be enhanced in some ways."
13:02,"For example, by sprouting"
13:05,and fermentation.
13:07,Soaking and roasting is also recommended.
13:12,All this helps in reducing the antinutrients from the food.
13:18,Antinutrients inhibit the absorption of some nutrients in our body.
13:25,Examples of antinutrients are oxalates and phytates.
13:31,Have adequate intake of vitamin B12
13:35,and maintain a healthy gut for a good health.
13:39,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for watching."
