00:12,The other reasons why a baby may not be getting enough breastmilk.
00:19,Recommended solutions for those reasons.
00:24,There are many reasons why a baby may not get enough breastmilk.
00:31,They are divided into 4 categories.
00:36,The first category is breastfeeding factors.
00:42,It is discussed in another tutorial in the same series.
00:48,The second category is the mother’s psychological factors.
00:54,The third category is the mother’s physical condition.
01:00,The fourth category is the baby’s physical condition.
01:06,Let us start with the second category of reasons.
01:11,We will discuss 5 common psychological factors of mothers.
01:18,The 1st psychological factor is the mother’s lack of confidence.
01:25,New mothers often question their ability to breastfeed properly.
01:31,Breastfeeding is a skill and it takes time to learn this skill.
01:38,Mothers must be patiently guided to learn the correct breastfeeding technique.
01:45,The 2nd psychological factor is the mother’s worry or stress.
01:52,New mothers are worried about the baby’s health.
01:57,Their worry increases in stressful times like a pandemic.
02:03,Worried mothers are often tempted to bottle feed.
02:09,"Also, the stress affects their milk supply."
02:14,Mothers must have a supporting family to rest and relax.
02:20,Their doubts must be resolved by regular follow-ups with an expert.
02:27,The 3rd psychological factor is the mother’s dislike of breastfeeding.
02:35,Some mothers do not prefer breastfeeding their baby.
02:40,This can result in the baby not getting enough breastmilk.
02:46,The 4th psychological factor is the mother’s rejection of the baby.
02:54,Some mothers express strong negative feelings about the baby.
03:01,They dislike and regret the birth of the baby.
03:06,"There is absence of affectionate behaviour such as kissing,"
03:11,"cuddling, etc."
03:15,They feel better when the baby is away from them.
03:20,"In such cases, the mother may not breastfeed the baby at all."
03:26,The 5th psychological factor is the mother’s tiredness.
03:33,New mothers are often sleep-deprived and
03:36,fatigued.
03:39,This may affect their breastmilk production.
03:44,It may also reduce the breastfeeding frequency.
03:49,"Next, we will discuss the third category of reasons."
03:54,It is the mother’s physical condition.
03:59,The mother may be using contraceptive pills or
04:03,blood pressure-lowering pills.
04:07,This may affect her breastmilk production.
04:12,"In such cases, she should consult her doctor to help her out."
04:18,Another factor that can affect breastfeeding is the mother’s pregnancy.
04:26,Some mothers stop breastfeeding when pregnant.
04:31,This may cause the child to not get enough nourishment.
04:37,Mother should know that it is safe to continue breastfeeding when pregnant.
04:44,The next factor is the mother’s severe malnutrition.
04:50,It can affect the composition of the breast milk.
04:55,"Also, the mother may be too weak to feed the baby adequately."
05:02,"If the mother drinks alcohol, it can decrease her milk production."
05:09,The baby may not get enough breastmilk.
05:14,Another factor is the mother’s smoking habits.
05:19,Smoking may decrease milk supply
05:22,and even change the composition of breastmilk.
05:28,The next factor is a remaining piece of the placenta in the mother.
05:34,It will not let the mother’s prolactin levels rise.
05:39,Prolactin is a hormone that helps in breastmilk production.
05:46,"Therefore, she may not be able to breastfeed adequately."
05:52,"However, this is a rare cause detected by doctors."
05:58,Poor breast development is another factor that can affect breastfeeding.
06:05,Some mothers may not have enough of the milk-making tissues in their breasts.
06:12,"Next, we will discuss the fourth category of reasons."
06:18,It is the baby’s physical condition.
06:23,"During sickness, the baby may stop breastfeeding"
06:27,or vomit breastmilk.
06:30,Many newborns have dry mucus in the nose.
06:35,This blocks their nose and affects their breathing while breastfeeding.
06:42,"Therefore, babies take their mouth off the breast frequently while breastfeeding."
06:50,Putting nasal saline drops in the baby’s nose can help clear mucus.
06:57,Nasal saline drops are available in the pharmacy.
07:02,4 to 5 drops in each nostril 15 minutes before feeding will clear the mucus.
07:11,It is important to breastfeed frequently to help the baby heal faster.
07:19,Some babies are born with birth defects.
07:24,"They include down syndrome,"
07:27,cleft lip or palate and
07:30,congenital heart disease.
07:34,They can also have poor muscle development.
07:39,This will further affect their ability to suck.
07:44,Such birth defects can affect the baby’s ability to breastfeed.
07:51,Exclusive breastfeeding is a must for a baby from birth to 6 months of age.
07:59,"For proper growth, a baby should be fed enough breastmilk every day."
08:06,"If there is any problem while breastfeeding, immediately consult an expert."
08:13,Ensure that the baby gets enough milk through breastfeeding.
