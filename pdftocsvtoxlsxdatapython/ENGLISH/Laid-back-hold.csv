00:01,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Laid-back hold for breastfeeding.
00:06,"In this tutorial we will learn, choosing the correct breastfeeding hold for a mother and herbaby."
00:15,Mother’s preparation before breastfeeding and How to do the laid-back hold.
00:22,Let us begin.
00:24,"Across the world, mothers breastfeed their babies using various types of holds."
00:31,"As discussed in an earlier tutorial- The best breastfeeding hold for a mother and her baby isthe one in which-"
00:39,Both mother and baby are comfortable for the entire duration of breastfeeding
00:47,"The baby is able to attach deeply to the mother’s breastAnd get sufficient milk."
00:55,Let us learn about one of the holds called Laid-back hold.
01:00,"Laid-back hold is recommended when - Deep attachment of the baby to the breast isdifficult using cross cradle or cradle hold"
01:09,Or if the mother has big breasts
01:12,Or if the mother has back pain
01:15,Or when the mother is tired.
01:18,"Before feeding her baby, the mother must wash her hands with soap and water.And dry her hands properly."
01:27,Then she should drink a glass of boiled and cooled water.
01:32,"Lactating mothers produce 750 to 850 mililitres of milk per day on an average.Therefore, they need to increase their daily water intake."
01:44,"Next, mother should uncover the breast from which she wants to feed the baby."
01:50,She should ensure not to put pressure of her bra or blouse on the breast.
01:55,"Then, the mother should lie down comfortably on the floor or on a bed."
02:01,"Her head, neck and upper back should be well supported by pillows."
02:07,"Now that the mother is ready, let us learn how to hold the baby correctly."
02:13,"Mother should-hold her baby’s body with the hand on the side of the breast that she willfeed from."
02:20,"She should hold the lower part of her baby's head- with the thumb and fingers of her otherhand."
02:27,"The mother in this picture, will be feeding her baby from her right breast."
02:32,"Therefore, she is using her right hand to hold the baby’s body."
02:37,She is using the thumb and fingers of her left hand to hold the lower part of her baby’s head.
02:46,"Next, Let us see the correct position of mother’s thumb and fingers for holding the baby’shead."
02:54,"Mother’s thumb should be-behind one ear, and rest of the fingers behind the other ear of thebaby."
03:02,She should not move her fingers or thumb from behind the ear to the baby’s neck.
03:08,"She should not apply pressure on the back of the baby’s head with her hand.This will keep the baby comfortable while feeding."
03:20,"Next, let us learn how to position the baby’s body correctly."
03:25,"The baby should be placed on the mother’s body in such a way that baby’s stomach is on themother’s stomach"
03:32,And the baby’s head is near the mother’s breast.
03:38,Lesser distance between the baby and the breast will help the baby to reach the breast.
03:44,And it will become easier for the baby to attach deeply.
03:49,"Then, the second important point is the direction in which the baby’s entire body is held."
03:56,"You may have noticed that- When we eat food, our head, neck and body are always in thesame direction."
04:05,"Similarly- Baby’s head, neck and body should always be in the same direction whilebreastfeeding."
04:14,This will make swallowing milk easier for the baby.
04:19,"Remember, the baby can be positioned on the mother’s body in any direction, as long as -the whole front part of the baby’s body is placed on the front part of the mother’s body"
04:32,And the baby can reach the breast easily.
04:38,Now we come to the third point in positioning the baby’s body.
04:42,The mother should support the full body of her baby.
04:47,"Otherwise, the baby will have to take a lot of effort to attach deeply to the breast."
04:54,"Next, let’s look at the position of baby’s nose and chin."
04:59,Baby’s nose should always be in line with the nipple.
05:03,And her chin should be forward and very close to the breast.
05:09,This will ensure that the baby takes in more of the lower part of the areola while latching.
05:15,"And therefore, will use the lower jaw to drink more milk efficiently."
05:21,Please note- Areola is the dark area around the nipple.
05:27,"Now, the baby is in laid back hold and ready to latch on for breastfeeding."
05:34,"In this hold, the baby can naturally attach deeply to the mother’s breast."
05:40,Deep attachment of the baby to the breast is explained in another video of the same series.
05:49,"As soon as the baby is deeply attached to the breast- mother can release the baby’s headfrom her handAnd use both her hands to support the baby’s body."
06:01,"In this position, the mother should lie back, relax and breastfeed."
06:07,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
