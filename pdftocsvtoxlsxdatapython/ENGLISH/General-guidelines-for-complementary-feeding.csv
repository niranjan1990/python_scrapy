00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on general guidelines for complementary feeding.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,The importance of starting complementary food for 6 month old babies.
00:17,Complementary feeding guidelines for 6 to 24 month old babies.
00:23,Let us begin.
00:25,A baby must be breastfed exclusively from the time of birth to 6 months of age.
00:33,6 months of age does not mean the start of the 6th month of a baby’s life.
00:40,She has completed 6 months and started the 7th month of her life.
00:47,"At this age, exclusive breastfeeding is not enough for a baby."
00:54,"Along with breastmilk, nutritious home-cooked food must be given to the baby."
01:00,This food is called complementary food.
01:05,It must be given to a baby from 6 months to 24 months of age.
01:13,"It plays a crucial role in making the baby tall, healthy and intelligent."
01:21,It is important to start complementary feeding at 6 months of age.
01:27,"Otherwise, the baby's growth and development will be hindered."
01:33,There are also chances that the baby might reject solid food at a later age.
01:41,"Remember, complementary food supports breastfeeding."
01:46,"Therefore, breastfeeding must be continued till at least 2 years of age."
01:54,"The type, consistency and amount of complementary food varies with baby’s age."
02:03,There are specific recommendations for each group.
02:08,They are discussed in detail in another tutorial in the same series.
02:14,"Now, let’s discuss important guidelines for complementary feeding at all ages."
02:23,Any new food must be first given separately to a baby.
02:29,It should be combined with other foods later.
02:33,This will help to assess if the baby is allergic to a particular food.
02:40,Eating a variety of foods is essential for good nutrition.
02:46,"Every 4th day, add a new food to the baby’s diet."
02:52,Start with 1 tablespoon of the new food along with the previously given food.
02:59,Gradually increase its amount every day.
03:03,Nutrient dense food from all 8 food groups must be added gradually.
03:11,The first and most important food group is breastfeeding.
03:17,It must be included every day along with other food groups.
03:22,"Grains, roots and tubers are the second food group."
03:28,"Legumes, seeds and nuts are the third group."
03:33,Fourth group is milk products.
03:37,"Meat, fish and chicken are the fifth group."
03:43,Egg is the sixth group.
03:46,Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables are the seventh group.
03:52,"Lastly, the eighth group is other fruits and vegetables."
03:58,"Ideally, a baby’s diet must include all 8 food groups."
04:05,"If a baby’s diet has less than 5 of these groups, it is a severe problem."
04:13,It must be corrected immediately.
04:16,Some babies do not have access to breastmilk at all.
04:22,Include food from the remaining 7 groups every day in their diet.
04:28,"Also, give them 500 ml of animal milk and 2 extra servings of meals per day."
04:39,Always boil the animal milk before feeding it to the baby.
04:45,"Now, let’s discuss the order of adding new food groups to a baby’s diet."
04:52,"Along with breastmilk, start giving complementary food from the first 6 groups."
05:00,Baby needs a higher quantity of nutrients after 6 months of age.
05:06,"However, the quantity of food that can be given in the initial days is small."
05:14,"Therefore, nutrient dense food from the first 6 groups can be given."
05:20,These foods are rich in nutrients such as protein and good fats.
05:27,They are important for the development of the baby's height and muscle mass.
05:34,Good fats are important for baby’s brain development.
05:40,"After these foods, start giving vegetables and fruits."
05:45,Vegetables and fruits are high in vitamins and minerals.
05:52,"However, they are not as dense in protein and fat as the first 6 groups."
06:00,"Therefore, they are started later to avoid weight stagnation or loss."
06:07,"Also, fruits are sweet to taste."
06:11,It is important that babies try a variety of tastes before the sweet taste.
06:18,Trying different tastes helps babies to accept more foods.
06:24,This reduces the chance of them becoming a picky eater later.
06:31,"Hence, fruits are added to a baby’s diet after adding all other types of food."
06:39,"Giving fresh, seasonal, local fruits once or twice a day is recommended."
06:47,Fruit can be given as a dessert after a regular meal.
06:52,Fruit puree should not be mixed with baby’s regular meals.
06:58,Fruit juice is not recommended for this age group.
07:03,It includes both homemade and readymade fruit juice.
07:09,"Remember, continue breastfeeding upto 2 years."
07:15,Avoid giving hard foods that may cause a baby to choke.
07:21,"Whole nuts, grapes, chickpeas and raw carrot pieces are examples of such foods."
07:30,"Freshly cooked homemade food, prepared hygienically, is the best for the baby."
07:37,"If baby food is to be stored, please watch our tutorial on safe storage."
07:44,Safe preparation and serving of baby food is also discussed in the same tutorial.
07:52,Please visit our website for more details.
07:56,"Along with food, boiled and cooled water can be given to a 6-month-old baby."
08:03,"Start with 30 to 60 ml of water, twice a day."
08:10,It should be increased in hot weather as per the baby’s demand.
08:16,Breast milk and water are the best drinks for a baby.
08:21,"However, they must be timed correctly."
08:25,Do not breastfeed or give water to a baby before a meal.
08:31,A hungry baby is more likely to try new foods.
08:37,Baby can be breastfed or given water 20 to 30 minutes before or after a meal.
08:46,Adequate complementary feeding is necessary for a baby to grow well.
