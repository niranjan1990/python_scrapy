Time,Narration
00:00,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Cradle hold for breastfeeding.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn about-"
00:09,"choosing the correct breastfeeding hold for a mother and her baby,"
00:15,mother’s preparation before breastfeeding and
00:18,how to do the Cradle hold.
00:22,"Let us begin.Across the world, mothers breastfeed their babies using various types of holds. As discussedin an earlier tutorial - The best breastfeeding hold for a mother and her baby is the one inwhich"
00:39,both mother and baby are comfortable for the entire duration of breastfeeding.
00:45,The baby is able to attach deeply to the mother’s breast
00:50,and get sufficient milk.
00:54,Let us learn about one of the holds called Cradle hold.
00:59,"Before feeding her baby, the mother must wash her hands with soap and water"
01:05,and dry her hands properly.
01:10,Then she should drink a glass of boiled and cooled water.
01:15,Lactating mothers produce 750 to 850 milliliters of milk per day on an average.
01:22,"Therefore, they need to increase their daily water intake."
01:27,"Next, let’s discuss the position of the mother."
01:31,Mother should sit on the floor or on the bed in cross-legged position.
01:36,Or on a chair with her feet flat on the ground.
01:41,If the chair is too high and her feet do not reach the floor then
01:47,she can rest her feet flat on a small stool or pillows kept on the floor.
01:53,"While sitting, she should ensure that -her back is straight so as to avoid back pain,"
02:00,her shoulders are relaxed and not elevated or curved.
02:05,"And, this relaxed position is maintained throughout the breastfeeding session."
02:12,"Now, the mother should uncover the breast from which she wants to feed the baby."
02:18,She should ensure not to put pressure of her bra or blouse on the breast.
02:25,"After sitting comfortably, bring the baby to the mother."
02:29,"Mother should hold her baby with the arm on the same side of the breast that she will feedfrom."
02:37,Baby’s head should rest comfortably in the inner bend of the elbow of that arm.
02:44,"With the same arm, mother should support the head, neck and torso of her baby."
02:51,"The mother in this picture, will feed the baby from her right breast."
02:56,"Therefore, she is using her right arm to support the baby’s head, neck and torso and"
03:05,the baby’s head is resting in the inner bend of her right elbow.
03:10,"If the mother wants additional support to lift the baby, she can keep a pillow under the babyon her lap."
03:19,"Remember, the mother should never bring the breast to the baby by bending her back."
03:25,This will make her uncomfortable and cause back pain.
03:30,She should always keep her back straight and lift the baby to reach her breast.
03:36,"Next, let us learn how to position baby’s body correctly."
03:42,The baby’s stomach should be gently pressed by the mother’s body.
03:47,Lesser distance between their bodies will reduce the baby’s effort to reach the breast.
03:54,And it will become easier for the baby to attach deeply.
04:00,"Then, the second important point is the direction in which the baby’s entire body is held."
04:08,"You may have noticed that when we eat food, our head, neck and body are always in thesame direction."
04:16,"But, while breastfeeding, the baby’s head is often turned sideways by many mothers."
04:23,This will make feeding uncomfortable for the baby.
04:28,"Baby’s head, neck and body should always be in the same direction while breastfeeding."
04:35,This will make swallowing milk easier for the baby.
04:41,Now we come to the third point in positioning the baby’s body.
04:46,"The mother should support the head, neck and torso of her baby."
04:51,Otherwise the baby will have to take a lot of effort to attach deeply to the breast.
04:58,"Next, let’s look at the position of the baby’s nose and chin."
05:03,Baby’s nose should be in line with the nipple.
05:07,And her chin should be forward and very close to the breast.
05:12,This will ensure that the baby takes in more of the lower part of the areola while latching
05:19,"and therefore, will use the lower jaw to drink more milk efficiently."
05:26,Please note - Areola is the dark area around the nipple.
05:32,"Now that the baby is positioned correctly,"
05:35,"let us learn, how to hold the breast."
05:39,"Using the fingers of the hand that is free, the mother should cup her breast in a U shape holdfrom the top."
05:48,The mother in this picture will use her left hand to hold her right breast.
05:55,"To understand the correct position of thumb and fingers, imagine the nipple to be the centerof a clock on the mother’s right breast."
06:04,Mother should place her left thumb at 3’O clock position on this clock
06:10,while her left index finger and middle finger should be placed at 9’O clock position.
06:18,Mother’s fingers holding the breast should always be in the direction of the baby’s lips.
06:25,"Why?Let’s understand this using a simple example."
06:30,"When we eat a vada-pav or burger, our lips open horizontally."
06:35,We hold the vada-pav or burger horizontally to take a big bite.
06:40,"Here, the thumb and fingers are placed in the direction of the lips."
06:46,"If we hold the vada-pav or burger vertically, we won’t be able to take a big bite."
06:53,"Similarly, observe the direction of baby’s lips. The lips are vertical here."
07:00,"Therefore, the fingers and thumb should also be placed vertically on the breast."
07:06,This will help the baby to take a big part of the lower areola in her mouth.
07:13,"In addition to being in the direction of the baby’s lips, mother’s thumb and fingers shouldalways be at a distance of 3 fingers from the nipple."
07:23,"Again, while eating a vada pav or burger, if we hold it too close, our fingers will block ourmouth from taking a big bite."
07:34,"If we hold it too far away, it will not be shaped correctly to fit in our mouth."
07:41,"Therefore, we hold it at the right distance to take a big bite."
07:47,"Similarly for the baby, the right distance is of 3 fingers from the nipple, as shown in thispicture."
07:55,"This distance will ensure that-mother’s fingers do not block the baby from taking a big part of the areola in her mouth,"
08:05,"mother does not compress only the nipple which will give very little milk,"
08:11,"mother compresses the larger milk-ducts beneath the areola to express more milk out,"
08:17,and the breast is shaped correctly to help the baby attach deeply.
08:23,"Remember - mother’s thumb should be on the side of the breast where the baby’s chin ispresent."
08:29,"And, her 2 fingers should be on the side of the breast where baby’s nose is present."
08:36,Let’s go back to the example of vada-pav or burger.
08:41,"After holding the vada-pav or burger correctly, we always press it to take a big bite."
08:48,"Similarly, the mother should lightly press her breast in a U shape hold from the top."
08:54,This will help the baby to take a big part of the lower areola in her mouth.
09:01,"But remember, mother should not press her breast in an inverted V shape hold."
09:07,V shape compression will pinch the breast and cause nipple feeding.
09:13,Also make sure that there is equal compression of the breast with the thumb and the fingers.
09:21,"Otherwise, the nipple will shift either to the right or the left side"
09:27,and the baby will not be able to attach deeply to the breast.
09:32,"Remember, never bring the breast to the baby by pushing it sideways towards the baby."
09:39,Always bring the baby towards the breast.
09:43,"Now, the baby is in Cradle hold and ready to attach to the breast for breastfeeding."
09:49,Correct attachment of the baby to the breast is explained in another video in the same series.
09:58,As soon as the baby is attached deeply to the breast and if the breast is not too heavy then
10:05,mother should release her breast from her hand
10:08,and bring that hand underneath the baby for support.
10:14,"In this position, mother should bring both her arms very close to her body."
10:20,This will keep her comfortable during breastfeeding.
10:25,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
