00:01,"Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Physical methods to increase the amount of breastMilk."
00:08,"In this tutorial, we will learn how to increase the amount of breast milk using differentphysical methods."
00:17,Let us first begin with Kangaroo mother care.
00:20,"In this method, the baby should be in skin-to-skin contact with the mother as long aspossible."
00:27,"Note that the procedure for Kangaroo mother care has been explained in another tutorialof the same series."
00:34,"Next, we will learn how to improve the Let down reflex or Oxytocin reflex.Before that, we should know what is Oxytocin?"
00:44,"Oxytocin is a hormone which encourages the Let down reflex because of which the milk ispushed out, just by thinking about the baby."
00:54,"Therefore, to push the milk out, first mother should relax and then look at her calm baby."
01:01,She can also smell her baby’s unwashed clothes and listen to soothing music as well.
01:08,"Alternately, other methods that will help to push the milk out are-hot water fomentation,"
01:16,massage of the upper back and massage of the breast.
01:20,Let us see how to do hot water fomentation.
01:24,Mother should take a warm water bath or keep a warm cloth on her breast.
01:30,Both these methods will help circulation of milk in the breast and push the milk out.
01:36,"Next, let us learn about massaging."
01:39,"Massaging of the upper back and neck will help the milk to flow freely, since the samenerve goes to the upper back and the breast."
01:48,Massaging the breast before feeding opens the milk ducts.
01:53,"Hence, the milk will flow freely and the breast will be emptied completely, leading tohigher milk production."
02:01,"Another method of increasing the amount of breast milk is to encourage the baby to latch oncorrectly."
02:09,Let us see how to do so.
02:12,"Rub the nipple on the upper lip of the baby.This will help the baby to open the mouth widely and will help with the correct latch andgive sufficient milk to the baby."
02:23,"Make sure, during breastfeeding-"
02:27,"mother supports the full body of the baby,"
02:30,"baby’s tummy should touch the mother’s tummy,"
02:33,"baby’s head, neck and body are always in a straight line,"
02:38,"baby’s nose is in the line with the mother’s nipple,"
02:42,"the chin should be brought forward and pushed into mother’s breast, the lower lip is curledoutward."
02:50,"Ensure that- the baby takes in more part of lower areola while latching so that, the upperareola is more visible than the lower areola."
03:00,"Please note, areola is the dark area around the nipple."
03:05,"Next, let us look at another physical method which is gentle pressing of the breast."
03:11,"To do so, gently hold and squeeze the breast during breastfeeding."
03:17,Gentle pressure on the milk glands helps to release more milk.
03:22,This will help to give out more milk with each suck of the baby.
03:27,Gentle pressing of the breast has been explained in another tutorial of same series.
03:33,"An interesting fact is that, night time feeding is important. Let us understand why?"
03:41,The amount of hormone Prolactin in breast milk is higher during the night.
03:46,"When the baby feeds more at night, it improves the amount of milk during breastfeeding,thereby helping in growth of the baby."
03:56,"Another important factor to increase the amount of breast milk is the breastfeedingfrequency."
04:04,"Baby should be fed minimum 10-12 times in 24 hours.And, it is also important to feed the baby at least 2-3 times at night."
04:15,Do not keep the baby hungry.
04:17,Watch out for early hunger signals such as baby moves her arms and legs.
04:23,Baby turns towards anything that is touched to her cheek and she opens her mouth.
04:30,"Remember, crying of the baby is a late signal of hunger. Therefore, feed the baby on earlyhunger signs."
04:39,"Also, removal of hind-milk is important.Hind-milk is the milk present in the back part of the breast."
04:48,It is made up of fats. It is thick in consistency.
04:53,"Therefore, mother should ensure complete emptying of one breast and then offer the otherbreast."
05:00,"Now, let us discuss about expressing the milk from the breast after feeding the baby."
05:06,Expressing is manual removal of milk with mother’s own hands.
05:11,"To do so, mother keeps her fingers and thumb at the margin of the areola and skin of thebreast."
05:18,"Then gently presses the areola inward towards the chest, compressing and then releasing."
05:26,It is done even if the baby has suckled completely.
05:31,Mother should remove the milk even in between two feeds.
05:35,Removing milk frequently will improve the amount of breast milk.
05:40,"Always remember the following: avoid use of artificial nipples and formula milk as theyreduce mother’s milk."
05:49,Avoid feeding cow or goat milk or formula milk.
05:53,Avoid nipple shields as it creates nipple confusion for the baby.
05:59,"Remember, the baby should be breastfed whenever she shows early hunger signs."
"",The health worker should build mother’s confidence by guiding her about correct latching
06:05,
"",technique.
"",Monitor the weight of the baby daily to ensure that the baby starts gaining 25 to 30 grams of
06:12,
"",weight per day.
"",This brings us to the end of this tutorial
