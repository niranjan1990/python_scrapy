00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the importance of vitamin C.
00:07,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:09,Role of vitamin C in the body.
00:13,Food sources of vitamin C.
00:16,Ways to increase vitamin C intake in our diet.
00:22,Vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin.
00:26,It plays a very important role in several body functions.
00:32,It is essential for the synthesis of collagen which acts like a cement.
00:39,"It holds the bones, muscles, skin and the whole body together."
00:46,"Tissues of our body like skin, hair, blood vessels and bones have collagen."
00:56,Vitamin C helps in recovery after a muscle or skeletal injury.
01:03,It helps in the healing of wounds.
01:07,It is also required for maintaining healthy skin.
01:13,Another role of vitamin C is that it acts as an antioxidant.
01:20,Antioxidants are substances that protect our body from damage by free radicals.
01:28,Free radicals are substances that are naturally produced in the body.
01:35,They become harmful only when they become excessive.
01:40,"Pollution,smoking,"
01:42,"alcohol,harmful chemicals increase free radicals production."
"",
01:49,"This results in cancer, diabetes, heart diseases and cataract."
01:56,Vitamin C reduces the formation of free radicals in the body.
02:03,"Thus, protecting our cells from damage."
02:07,Vitamin C also strengthens our immune system.
02:12,It helps in fighting infections and protecting against other diseases.
02:19,"For example: common cold, cancer and heart diseases."
02:25,Vitamin C helps in bone formation.
02:28,It also helps in the synthesis of a few hormones.
02:33,"For example: dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline."
02:39,These hormones help the body respond to stress or fright.
02:46,"In addition, vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme iron in the body."
02:54,Non-heme iron is a form of iron which is mostly present in plant based foods.
03:02,"For example: green leafy vegetables, seeds, nuts and beans."
03:09,Consuming too little vitamin C can increase the risk of iron deficiency.
03:17,This may result in anemia which is known as iron deficiency anemia.
03:24,Deficiency of vitamin C can result in scurvy.
03:30,"Early signs of scurvy are uneasiness,"
03:33,"feverand fatigue."
03:37,Other symptoms are swelling and bleeding in gums and
03:41,loosening of teeth.
03:44,Poor healing of wounds and bruises and bleeding on the skin is visible.
03:51,Swelling and pain in the joints may also arise.
03:56,The hair becomes dry and coiled.
04:01,"Other signs of deficiency are dry skin, mood changes and poor immunity."
04:09,Iron deficiency anemia can also occur due to vitamin C deficiency.
04:16,Let us now look at the daily vitamin C recommendation.
04:22,"For babies upto 12 months of age, 25 milligrams per day is recommended."
04:30,"For children who are 1-10 year old, 40 milligrams per day is recommended."
04:38,"For adolescents, 45-75 milligrams per day is recommended."
04:46,"For adult females, it is 75 milligrams."
04:52,90 milligrams is recommended for adult males.
04:58,The requirements are higher during pregnancy and lactation.
05:04,Pregnant women should have 85 milligrams of vitamin C per day.
05:10,Lactating mothers should have 120 milligrams per day.
05:16,Let me now tell you the food sources of vitamin C.
05:21,Certain fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C.
05:27,"Among fruits, gooseberry and guava are the richest sources."
05:33,1 medium-sized guava gives around 300 milligrams of vitamin C.
05:40,1 gooseberry has nearly 60 milligrams of vitamin C.
05:46,"Other examples are: bengal currant, indian jujube and raw mango."
05:54,"Fruits like oranges, lemons and sweet limes are also good sources."
06:01,1 tablespoon of lemon juice has approximately 8 milligrams of vitamin C.
06:09,1 medium orange has about 40 milligrams.
06:14,Even green leafy vegetables have an adequate amount of vitamin C.
06:21,"For example:Leaves of drumstick (moringa -Bracketed text is only for International languages),"
06:24,"amaranth,radish"
06:26,and mustard.
06:28,Fenugreek leaves and agathi leaves are other examples.
06:34,100 grams of raw green leafy vegetables have about 60-100 milligrams.
06:43,Coriander and mint leaves also have some amount of vitamin C.
06:49,Some other vegetables also have moderate amounts of vitamin C.
06:56,"For example: capsicum, cabbage, drumsticks, bitter gourd, tomatoes and peas."
07:05,100 grams or 2 raw tomatoes have 27 milligrams of vitamin C.
07:13,There are certain factors which decrease the vitamin C content of the food.
07:20,It is sensitive to heat and water.
07:24,It is lost if cooked at high temperature
07:27,or exposed to prolonged sunlight.
07:32,Cooking in excessive water and discarding the water also results in loss.
07:39,Storing food in the refrigerator for a long time reduces the vitamin C content.
07:46,"Thus, many of the vitamin C rich foods are best consumed raw."
07:54,This way you get the maximum amount of vitamin C from it.
08:00,"If they are cooked, they should be cooked on low flame for short durations."
08:08,Steam or saute vegetables instead of boiling.
08:14,"Upon steaming, the loss of vitamin C is the least."
08:20,Do not repetitively heat the food.
08:24,Cook with minimum or no water.
08:28,Avoid storing and refrigerating food for a long time.
"",
08:34,Let us learn some ways to increase our daily intake of vitamin C.
08:40,Eat fresh fruits and vegetables.
08:44,Pick the raw fruits as they have more vitamin C.
08:49,Try having a food source of vitamin C with every meal.
08:55,"With your meals you can have mint, curry leaf or coriander dips (sauce made up of spicesor nuts or seeds or vegetables â€“ Bracketed text is only for International languages)."
09:02,Lemon juice can be sprinkled on your food.
09:07,Garnish your meals with coriander leaves or mint leaves after cooking.
09:13,You can also increase the vitamin C content of your food by sprouting.
09:20,As much as possible include sprouted beans in your diet.
09:26,All these methods will ensure that we get adequate vitamin C from our diet.
09:33,Adequate intake of vitamin C is necessary for our good health.
09:39,"This brings us to the end of the tutorial.Thank you for watching."
