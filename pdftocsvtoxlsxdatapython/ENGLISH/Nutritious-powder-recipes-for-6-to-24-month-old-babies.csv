00:01,"Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Nutritious powder recipes for 6 to 24 month oldchildren."
00:08,In this tutorial we will learn various recipes of nutritious powders such as-
00:14,amylase powder
00:17,powder of seeds
00:19,powder of nuts and seeds
00:22,powder of beans
00:24,powder of curry leaves
00:26,and powder of drumstick leaves
00:29,There are various nutritious powders which can be made at home without much effort.
00:36,These powders have nutrients which support the growth and development of infants.
00:42,It is recommended that:
00:44,These powders should be given to the baby when she completes 6 months of age.
00:51,Whenever any powder is introduced to a baby-
00:54,It should be added in baby’s food for 3 or 4 consecutive days.
00:59,"After 3 or 4 days, introduce a new powder to the baby."
01:05,These two powders can be mixed but both powders should have been tried individually
01:10,"and the baby should not have had any allergies like rashes or swelling on the face and thebody."
01:19,"Whenever any powder containing allergens such as nuts is introduced to the child, then-"
01:26,start with the small portion such as the tip of a teaspoon
01:31,wait for 10 minutes and then gradually feed it to the child.
01:36,"Please, do not add salt in baby’s food till she turns one."
01:41,"Also, do not include sugar and jaggery until the baby is 2 years of age."
01:47,Now let’s learn how to make these nutritious powders at home.
01:52,But before that keep in mind-
01:54,The recipes in this tutorial have been made using the following methods-
02:00,"SoakingRoasting"
02:03,germination
02:05,and cooking
02:07,Cooking may include any one or combination of following methods:
02:12,dry roasting
02:14,"steamingand boiling"
02:17,"All these methods will reduce Phytates and Oxalates in the food which prevents absorptionof minerals from the food"
02:26,and will improve nutrient absorption from the food.
02:30,"Now, let’s begin with our first recipe:"
02:33,"Amylase powderBut first, let us discuss the benefits of it-"
02:39,Amylase is an enzyme or chemical required for the digestion of food.
02:45,It is produced in a limited amount in the baby’s body.
02:50,This powder provides additional amylase and
02:53,increases nutrient content and absorption from the food in which it is added.
02:59,"Thus, amylase rich flour or amylase powder should be given to the baby."
03:05,Let's learn the recipe for Amylase powder.
03:08,Ingredients required for making Amylase powder are-
03:13,1⁄2 cup of Wheat
03:15,1⁄2 cup of Green Gram and
03:17,1⁄2 cup of Ragi
03:19,"Procedure:First, soak all the items separately in water for around 10 hours."
03:25,Soaking will improve the moisture content of ingredients.
03:29,After 10 hours remove all the items.
03:33,Keep them in a strainer and let all the water drain out.
03:38,"Then, one by one tie all the ingredients in a clean and dry cotton cloth."
03:43,Keep them aside till they sprout.
03:46,This process is called Germination.
03:49,Note that-
03:51,Some items will take longer time and
03:53,Some will take a shorter period of time for germination.
03:57,"Here, Ragi will take longer time than other ingredients."
04:02,After germination dry them in the sunlight for a day or two.
04:07,"After drying, roast all the items on a low flame till they completely dry off."
04:14,"Remember:During roasting, continuous stirring is required."
04:20,"Next, separate the outer cover of all items by rubbing between clean hands."
04:26,"After removing the outer cover, mix all the ingredients."
04:30,Now make a powder of this mixture using the grinder.
04:35,And the Amylase powder is ready.
04:39,Store this Amylase powder in an airtight container.
04:43,One can add 1 teaspoon of Amylase powder in various baby food before cooking such as-
04:49,thick dals

04:59,1 teaspoon of Amylase powder gives
05:02,around 18 calories and
05:04,0.6 grams of protein
05:07,Amylase powder has some unique properties which makes it special for a baby.
05:13,It decreases the thickness of the food.
05:16,"Hence, more amylase powder can be added in baby's food."
05:20,As it reduces the bulk of the baby's food and makes it nutrient-dense.
05:27,"Next, we will learn the recipe for powder of seeds."
05:31,"This powder is rich in Zinc,fibre,"
05:35,"Magnesiumand Calcium."
05:38,These nutrients help in bone development and improve the strength of the baby.

08:20,After 10 hours remove all the items.
08:23,Keep them in a sieve and let all the water drain out.
08:27,"Then, one by one tie all the beans in a clean and dry cotton cloth."
08:32,Keep them aside till they sprout.
08:34,This entire process is called germination.
08:38,"Please note: As we discussed earlier, the duration of germination will be different for eachingredient."
08:45,After germination dry them in the sunlight for a day or two.
08:50,"Then, roast all the beans on a medium flame till they completely dry off."
08:55,"During roasting,continuous stirring is required."
08:59,It will avoid burning of all ingredients.

10:10,"Next let’s learn, how to make the powder of Drumstick leaves-"
10:15,"This powder contains a good amount of Calcium,"
