00:00,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on essential nutrition actions for pregnant women.
00:08,In this tutorial we will learn about:
00:11,Nutrient requirements during pregnancy.
00:15,Nutrition actions required during pregnancy.
00:20,Essential nutrition actions are also known as ENA.
00:26,ENA is an approach to improve the nutritional status of women and children.
00:34,"During pregnancy, a woman's body undergoes physical"
00:38,and hormonal changes.
00:41,Her nutritional needs also increase.
00:45,Nutrition in this period is important for the health of the mother and child.
00:52,A baby in the mother's womb is dependent on its mother for nutrition.
01:00,"Time span from conception to the baby's second birthday is the first 1,000 days."
01:08,This is the period of rapid growth and
01:11,mental development.
01:14,It also determines the present and future health of the baby and it’s mother.
01:21,For the mother a nutritious diet provides her relief from nausea and weakness.
01:29,It helps in brain development of the fetus.
01:33,It also helps in reducing risk of birth defects in babies
01:39,and anemia in mothers.
01:42,Let’s discuss the nutrients and
01:45,nutrition actions required during pregnancy.
01:50,There are many essential nutrients required during pregnancy.
01:56,Protein is one of them.
01:59,To meet the protein requirements it is advised to eat protein rich food.
02:06,"Meat, fish, chicken, and eggs are excellent sources of protein."
02:14,"Pulses, beans, nuts, seeds, milk and milk products are other good sources."
02:23,Essential fatty acids are also vital during pregnancy.
02:30,These are also called as good fats.
02:34,For example: DHA and EPA.
02:39,"Fish, nuts and seeds are good sources of these fatty acids."
02:46,Let’s move on to other nutrients required during pregnancy.
02:52,Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and
02:56,fetal cell development.
02:58,It also helps in reducing neural tube defects in infants.
03:04,Including folate in daily diet during pregnancy is essential.
03:11,"Sprouts, green leafy vegetables, and chicken liver are good sources of folate."
03:19,"Along with folate, Iron also plays an important role during pregnancy."
03:26,Iron is required for the production of red blood cells.
03:32,It helps in carrying oxygen to the entire body.
03:37,"During pregnancy, there is a rise in blood volume."
03:42,"Hence, women require a large amount of iron."
03:47,This helps in meeting the requirements of the growing fetus.
03:53,A reserve of iron is created in the fetus which can be used by them after birth.
04:01,Deficiency of iron can result in anemia.
04:06,"To prevent anemia, the diet should include iron rich foods."
04:11,"Chicken or goat’s liver, brain, heart are good sources of iron."
04:19,"Seafood, eggs and garden cress seeds are other examples."
04:26,"Iron is also present in beans,"
04:29,green leafy vegetables
04:31,and seeds.
04:34,Turmeric powder and coriander seeds also have some amounts of iron.
04:40,Anemia can also be caused due to parasite and
04:44,worm infections.
04:47,"To prevent this, a pregnant woman should take deworming medicine."
04:52,One dose of deworming medicine is recommended during the second trimester.
04:59,Remember that tea and coffee should not be consumed along with meals.
05:05,This will interfere with the iron absorption.
05:10,"Interestingly, Vitamin C improves the absorption of Iron in our body."
05:16,"To do so, eat iron rich food and"
05:19,supplements with vitamin C rich food.
05:24,"Gooseberry, tomatoes, guava are rich sources of vitamin C."
05:30,Iron and folate requirements increase during pregnancy.
05:35,Diet alone does not fulfill these requirements.
05:40,"Thus, Iron folic acid supplement is recommended."
05:46,"However, a prenatal supplement does not replace a healthy diet."
05:52,A prenatal supplement is taken before and during pregnancy.
06:00,Pregnant women should ask for iron folic acid tablets from health workers.
06:07,These tablets are provided by anganwadi centers.
06:12,The tablet should be taken once a day.
06:16,Pregnant women should take precautions while taking iron folic acid tablet.
06:23,Tablets should be taken 2 hours after a meal to avoid nausea and discomfort.
06:31,"At times, she may pass black stools after consuming these tablets."
06:37,Loose motion or constipation can also occur.
06:43,"However, these symptoms will settle after a few days."
06:48,"Also, iron folic acid tablet should not be taken along with calcium tablets."
06:55,They should be taken as morning and evening doses.
07:01,Calcium is another vital nutrient required during pregnancy.
07:06,Calcium deficiency in pregnant women causes high blood pressure.
07:12,It leads to swelling of the hand and feet.
07:17,To avoid deficiency she should include milk and milk products in her daily diet.
07:25,"Seeds, nuts, green leafy vegetables and dried fish also contain calcium."
07:34,Calcium supplements are also recommended during and after pregnancy.
07:41,Calcium tablets are provided by ICDS centers
07:46,and primary healthcare centers.
07:49,ICDS is an integrated child development service.
07:56,These tablets are given from 14 weeks of pregnancy upto 6 months after delivery.
08:05,The tablet has to be taken twice a day.
08:08,Excess amount of calcium inhibits iron absorption.
08:14,"Hence, two calcium tablets should not be consumed together."
08:19,One tablet should be consumed after breakfast or lunch.
08:25,The other tablet can be consumed after an evening snack or dinner.
08:31,Do not consume a calcium tablet on an empty stomach as it will cause gastritis.
08:38,Gastritis is the inflammation of the stomach lining.
08:44,Another nutrient that plays a vital role is iodine.
08:49,Iodine is required for good health throughout all stages of life.
08:56,Iodine cannot be stored well in the body.
09:00,"Hence, small quantities of iodine is required daily."
09:06,"Fish, prawns, milk, cheese, and iodized salt are good sources of iodine."
09:16,"To prevent Iodine deficiency, iodized salt should be used."
09:22,Iodized salt is easily available in the local market.
09:27,"While using iodised salt, a few precautions should be taken."
09:33,It should be added at the end of the cooking.
09:37,Iodised salt is sensitive to heat and light.
09:42,Excess exposure to heat and light could destroy the iodine in the salt.
09:49,"Hence, store it in a tightly sealed dark container."
09:54,Other nutrients that play a vital role during pregnancy are choline and zinc.
10:02,Vitamin B12 and magnesium are also important.
10:08,"Choline, folate and vitamin B12 together reduce neural tube defects."
10:15,Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the brain and spinal cord.
10:23,Choline is also essential for brain development.
10:27,Whereas zinc helps in fetal development.
10:32,More information about these nutrients are explained in other tutorials.
10:39,Please watch individual tutorials of these nutrients
10:44,"For example: importance of protein,"
10:47,importance of choline
10:49,and folate.
10:51,Also watch the importance of calcium and
10:55,B12.
10:57,A healthy diet is critical for both mother and child’s health.
11:03,Mother’s diet must include different food groups.
11:07,"The first food group is grains, roots, white tubers and plantains."
11:15,Pulses are second group and
11:18,nuts and seeds are third group.
11:22,Fourth group is dairy.
11:25,"Meat, chicken and fish are the fifth group."
11:31,The sixth group is eggs.
11:34,Dark green leafy vegetables are the seventh group.
11:40,The eighth group is vitamin A rich vegetables.
11:45,Rest of the vegetables and fruits are ninth and tenth groups.
11:52,She should include at least 6 food groups in her daily diet.
11:58,"From these groups, she should include protein rich food groups and good fats."
12:06,She should make sure to decrease consumption of starchy food.
12:12,"Along with nutrients, water intake is also important."
12:17,It is recommended to include at least 8 glasses of water daily.
12:24,"Processed sugary, salty food and caffeinated drinks should be avoided."
12:31,Even alcohol and smoking should be strictly avoided.
12:36,Remember all the nutrition actions mentioned in this tutorial.
12:42,They are important for a healthy pregnancy
12:45,and healthy fetal development.
12:49,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thanks for joining."
