Time,Narration
00:01,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on WHO length-for-age percentile growth charts.
00:10,"In this tutorial, we will learn about:"
00:13,2 types of percentile growth charts.
00:18,Growth indicators.
00:21,The plot points for growth indicators.
00:26,Let us begin by understanding what are percentile growth charts?
00:33,They are charts designed to help you follow a child’s growth.
00:39,They were developed through the World Health Organisation’s MGRS.
00:47,MGRS means Multicentre Growth Reference Study.
00:54,"8,500 selected children from 6 different countries were measured."
01:01,"The countries were India,"
01:04,"Brazil,Ghana,"
01:06,"Norway,Oman"
01:08,and the USA.
01:11,The children were from different cultural backgrounds.
01:17,3 things were kept constant among them.
01:21,All the selected children were breastfed.
01:26,They all were vaccinated.
01:30,They all had access to a clean environment.
01:35,It showed that children from different countries grew in a similar way.
01:42,This means the environment played a major role in their growth.
01:48,"Good nutrition, health and sanitation is required for proper growth."
01:55,The average weight and length for each age and gender were established.
02:03,Growth charts compare a child's length and weight with other children.
02:10,These children are of the same age and gender as the child.
02:17,These charts provide an early warning that a child has a growth problem.
02:24,"In this tutorial, we will discuss 2 types of percentile growth charts."
02:32,Each growth chart is used to measure a specific growth indicator.
02:38,Growth indicators are used to assess growth.
02:44,They take a child’s age and measurements together into consideration.
02:51,The first growth indicator is length-for-age.
02:57,The second one is weight-for-age.
03:02,"These indicators are plotted on growth charts over weeks, months or years."
03:10,This helps us to identify any growth problems.
03:16,It is important to use growth charts as per the child’s gender.
03:23,The growth charts used in this tutorial are from the World Health Organisation.
03:30,They are for children in the 0 to 2 years age group.
03:36,These growth charts are available on their website www.who.int
03:46,Please select the appropriate charts as per the child’s gender.
03:52,Download and print them.
03:56,"Next, let’s learn more about the first type of percentile growth chart."
04:03,It is the length-for-age growth chart.
04:07,It is used to plot the length-for-age growth indicator.
04:14,This indicator can help identify children who are stunted or short.
04:21,Such children might have had prolonged undernutrition or repeated illness.
04:29,Children who are tall for their age can also be identified.
04:35,"In these charts, the horizontal reference line at the bottom is the X-axis."
04:43,It shows age.
04:46,Exact age is plotted in weeks and months from birth until 2 years of age.
04:54,The vertical reference line at the left side is the Y-axis.
05:01,It shows length in centimetres.
05:06,The thin grey horizontal lines represent an increase in length by 1 cm.
05:15,Let’s go through the steps to plot length-for-age in these charts.
05:22,"First, mark the exact age, months and years, on the x-axis with a point."
05:31,"Then, mark the length on the y-axis with a point."
05:36,Extend it over the connected horizontal line till the marked point for age.
05:44,Extend the marked point for age over the connected vertical line.
05:51,The point where two extended lines intersect is called a plotted point.
05:59,"For every child, points are plotted over weekly or monthly measurements."
06:06,Check whether a plotted point seems sensible.
06:11,"If necessary, re-measure the child."
06:15,"For example, a baby’s length should not be shorter than at the previous visit."
06:23,"If it is, then one of the measurements was wrong."
06:28,Let us use an example to understand plotting on this chart.
06:35,This graph shows Anita’s length-for-age plotted 3 times over a few months.
06:43,"At this point, Anita was 3 months of age and 64 cm in length."
06:51,"Now here, at this point, Anita was 70 cm in length at 6 months of age."
07:02,"Finally, here at this point, she was 78 cm in length at 1 year of age."
07:12,"Now, let’s learn more about the 5 curved coloured lines on growth charts."
07:21,These 5 curved lines show selected percentiles.
07:28,"They are 3rd, 15th, 50th, 85th and 97th percentiles."
07:38,The 3rd and 97th percentiles are shown by red coloured lines.
07:46,The 15th and 85th percentiles are shown by orange coloured lines.
07:54,The 50th percentile is shown by a green coloured line.
08:01,These percentiles indicate the rank of the child’s measurement.
08:08,Let’s understand each percentile line with specific examples.
08:15,"In this graph, Madhav’s length is plotted on the 3rd percentile line."
08:22,It means that 97% of children of his age are taller than him.
08:30,Only 3% of children of his age are shorter than him.
08:37,"In this graph, Anu’s length is plotted on the 15th percentile line."
08:44,It means that 85% of children of her age are taller than her.
08:52,Only 15% of children of her age are shorter than her.
09:00,"In this graph, Priya’s length is plotted on the 50th percentile line."
09:07,The length of 50% of children is on this percentile line.
09:14,"Therefore, Priya’s length is the average length among the children of her age."
09:21,"In this graph, Rohan’s length is plotted on the 85th percentile line."
09:29,It means that 15% of children of his age are taller than him.
09:37,85% of children of his age are shorter than him.
09:44,"In this graph, Fatima’s length is plotted on the 97th percentile."
09:51,It means that 3% of children of her age are taller than her.
09:58,97% of children of her age are shorter than her.
10:05,"Next, let’s discuss the average length of a child from birth to 2 years of age."
10:15,It is along the 50th percentile line in the length-for-age growth chart.
10:22,Average birth length of a girl is 49 cm.
10:28,"At 1 month, the average length of a girl is 54 cm."
10:36,"At 3 months, it is 60 cm."
10:41,"At 6 months, it is 66 cm."
10:47,"At 1 year, it is 74 cm."
10:53,"At 2 years, the average length of a girl is 86.5 cm."
11:01,Average birth length of a boy is 50 cm.
11:07,"At 1 month, the average length of a boy is 55 cm."
11:15,"At 3 months, it is 61.5 cm."
11:21,"At 6 months, it is 67.5 cm."
11:28,"At 1 year, it is 76 cm."
11:34,"At 2 years, the average length of a boy is 88 cm."
11:42,The second percentile growth chart is called the weight-for-age growth chart.
11:49,It is discussed in another tutorial in the same series.
11:55,Growth problems are also discussed in the same tutorial.
12:00,Please visit our website for more details.
12:05,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
