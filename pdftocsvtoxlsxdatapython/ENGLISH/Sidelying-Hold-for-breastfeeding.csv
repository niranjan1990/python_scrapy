00:01,Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Side-Lying hold for breastfeeding.
00:06,"In this tutorial, we will learn- choosing the correct breastfeeding hold for a mother and herbaby,"
00:13,mother’s preparation before breastfeeding and how to do the side-lying hold.
00:19,"Let us begin. Across the world, mothers breastfeed their babies using various types of holds."
00:27,"As discussed in an earlier tutorial,the best breastfeeding hold for a mother and her baby is the one in which both mother andbaby are comfortable for the entire duration of breastfeeding,"
00:40,the baby is able to attach deeply to the mother’s breast
00:44,and gets sufficient milk.
00:49,Let us learn about a new hold called the Side-lying hold.
00:54,This hold is recommended when the mother is breastfeeding at night
00:58,or when the mother has had a caesarean section delivery
01:03,or when the mother is tired.
01:06,"Before feeding her baby, the mother must wash her hands with soap and water. And dry herhands properly."
01:14,Then she should drink a glass of boiled and cooled water.
01:18,"Lactating mothers produce 750 to 850 ml of milk per day on an average.Therefore, they need to increase their daily water intake."
01:30,"Next, mother should uncover the breast from which she wants to feed the baby."
01:35,She should ensure not to put pressure of her bra or blouse on the breast.
01:41,"Next, the mother should lie down comfortably on the side of the breast that she will feedfrom."
01:48,"She should keep a pillow under her head. And a pillow between her legs to avoid rollingover in her sleep."
01:57,"The mother in this picture, will be feeding her baby from her right breast. Therefore, she islying on her right side."
02:06,"Next, let us learn how to position baby’s body correctly."
02:12,Place the baby on her side such that her stomach is gently pressed by the mother’s body.
02:21,The mother should support her baby's back with the hand on the side that she is lying on.
02:29,The mother in this picture is supporting her baby’s back with her right hand.
02:35,The mother can place a pillow behind her baby’s back to hold her close to her body.
02:42,Lesser distance between their bodies will reduce the baby’s effort to reach the breast.
02:49,"And, it will become easier for the baby to attach deeply to the breast."
02:54,"Remember, the mother should never bring the breast to the baby by bending her back.This will increase the distance between the baby’s stomach and mother’s body."
03:06,She should always keep her back straight and bring the baby to her breast.
03:12,The second important point is the direction in which the baby’s entire body is held.
03:21,"You may have noticed that when we eat food, our head, neck and body are always in thesame direction."
03:30,"Similarly, baby’s head, neck and body should always be in the same direction whilebreastfeeding"
03:39,This will make swallowing milk easier for the baby.
03:44,"Now, we come to the third point in positioning the baby’s body."
03:50,Mother should support the baby’s back with her hand.
03:54,"Otherwise, the baby will have to take a lot of effort to attach deeply to the breast."
04:01,"Next, let’s look at the position of the baby’s nose and chin."
04:07,Baby’s nose should be in line with the nipple.
04:12,And her chin should be forward and very close to the breast.
04:17,This will ensure that the baby takes in more of the lower part of the areola while latching.
04:25,"And therefore, will use the lower jaw to drink more milk efficiently."
04:32,Please note- Areola is the dark area around the nipple.
04:39,"Now that the baby is held correctly, let us learn how to hold the breast."
04:46,"Using the fingers of the hand that is free, the mother should cup her breast from the side in aC shape hold."
04:55,The mother in this picture will use her left hand to hold her right breast.
05:05,"The fingers holding the breast, should always be in the direction of the baby’s lips."
05:12,Why? Let’s understand this using a simple example.
05:18,"When we eat a vada pav or burger, our lips open horizontally."
05:25,We hold the vada-pav or burger horizontally to take a big bite.
05:30,"Here, the thumb and fingers are placed in the direction of the lips."
05:36,"If we hold the vada-pav or burger vertically, we won’t be able to take a big bite."
05:43,"Similarly, observe the direction of baby’s lips. The lips are horizontal here."
05:50,"Therefore, mother’s fingers and thumb should also be placed horizontally on the breast."
05:58,This will help the baby to take a big part of the lower areola in her mouth.
06:05,"In addition to being in the direction of the baby’s lips, mother’s thumb and fingers shouldalways be at a distance of 3 fingers from the nipple."
06:17,"Again, while eating a vada-pav or burger, if we hold it too close, our fingers will block ourmouth from taking a big bite."
06:28,"If we hold it too far away, it will not be shaped correctly to fit in our mouth."
06:34,"Therefore, we hold it at the right distance to take a big bite."
06:39,"Similarly for the baby, the right distance is of 3 fingers from the nipple as shown in thispicture."
06:48,"This distance will ensure that mother’s fingers do not block the baby from taking the lowerareola in her mouth."
06:58,Mother does not compress only the nipple which will give very little milk.
07:05,Mother compresses the larger milk ducts beneath the areola to express more milk out.
07:12,"And, the breast is shaped correctly to help the baby attach deeply."
07:19,Let’s go back to the example of vada-pav or burger.
07:24,"After holding the vada-pav or burger correctly, we always press it to take a big bite."
07:32,"Similarly, the mother should lightly press her breast in a C shape hold from the side."
"",This will help the baby to take a big part of the breast in her mouth.
07:46,"But remember, mother should not press her breast in a scissor shape hold."
07:53,Scissor shape compression will pinch the breast and cause nipple feeding.
08:00,"Also, make sure that there is equal compression of the breast with the thumb and thefingers."
08:07,"Otherwise, the nipple will shift either in the upward or downward direction."
08:14,"And, the baby will not be able to attach deeply to the breast."
08:19,"Now, the baby is in the side lying hold and ready to attach to the breast for breast feeding."
08:26,Correct attachment of the baby to the breast is explained in another video in the same series.
08:33,"As soon as the baby is attached deeply to the breast, mother should release the breast fromher hand."
08:41,She should use this hand to hold the baby’s back and keep the baby close to her body.
08:48,"Also, she should move her other arm from the baby’s back and keep it at 90 degrees to herbody."
08:57,She should bend the elbow of that arm. Then she should tuck that hand under the pillow.
09:04,The mother in this picture has released her right breast from her left hand.
09:11,She is using her left hand to hold the baby’s back and keep the baby close to her body.
09:18,She has removed her right hand from the baby’s back.
09:22,She has kept it at 90 degrees to her body.
09:26,"Her right elbow is bent,"
09:28,her right hand is tucked under the pillow.
09:33,"After feeding from the first breast-if the mother wants to feed from her other breast then she will have to lie down on the otherside."
09:43,The mother in this picture has turned to her left side to feed from her left breast.
09:49,"This brings us to the end of this tutorial.Thank you for joining."
